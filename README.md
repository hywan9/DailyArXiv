| **[Dynamic Relational Priming Improves Transformer in Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12196v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Standard attention mechanisms in transformers employ static token representations that remain unchanged across all pair-wise computations in each layer. This limits their representational alignment with the potentially diverse relational dynamics of each token-pair interaction. While they excel in domains with relatively homogeneous relationships, standard attention's static relational learning struggles to capture the diverse, heterogeneous inter-channel dependencies of multivariate time series (MTS) data--where different channel-pair interactions within a single system may be governed by entirely different physical laws or temporal dynamics. To better align the attention mechanism for such domain phenomena, we propose attention with dynamic relational priming (prime attention). Unlike standard attention where each token presents an identical representation across all of its pair-wise interactions, prime attention tailors each token dynamically (or per interaction) through learnable modulations to best capture the unique relational dynamics of each token pair, optimizing each pair-wise interaction for that specific relationship. This representational plasticity of prime attention enables effective extraction of relationship-specific information in MTS while maintaining the same asymptotic computational complexity as standard attention. Our results demonstrate that prime attention consistently outperforms standard attention across benchmarks, achieving up to 6.5\% improvement in forecasting accuracy. In addition, we find that prime attention achieves comparable or superior performance using up to 40\% less sequence length compared to standard attention, further demonstrating its superior relational modeling capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Time-Series Foundation Model by Universal Delay Embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12080v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study introduces Universal Delay Embedding (UDE), a pretrained foundation model designed to revolutionize time-series forecasting through principled integration of delay embedding representation and Koopman operator prediction. Leveraging Takens' embedding theorem, UDE as a dynamical representation of observed data constructs two-dimensional subspace patches from Hankel matrices, theoretically preserving dynamical and topological properties of underlying dynamical systems. Such patches are viewed as images, which can be efficiently processed by exploiting advanced deep learning technologies. Computationally, these patches further serve as tokens for learning a self-attention encoder, thus enabling accurate prediction of nonlinear time-series by a finite-dimensional Koopman operator in a linear manner in a latent space. Extensive evaluations across various benchmarks and real-world climate datasets demonstrate over 20% average reduction in mean squared error versus state-of-the-art foundation models, alongside superior generalization in fine-tuning scenarios. In particular, the learned dynamical representations and Koopman operator prediction forms from the patches exhibit exceptional interpretability, with consistent identification of topologically informative subspaces and robust encoding of domain-invariant dynamics, establishing UDE as a scalable, interpretable framework for universal time-series modeling and forecasting with broad scientific and industrial applicability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Fetal Pose Estimation across Gestational Ages via Cross-Population Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12062v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fetal motion is a critical indicator of neurological development and intrauterine health, yet its quantification remains challenging, particularly at earlier gestational ages (GA). Current methods track fetal motion by predicting the location of annotated landmarks on 3D echo planar imaging (EPI) time-series, primarily in third-trimester fetuses. The predicted landmarks enable simplification of the fetal body for downstream analysis. While these methods perform well within their training age distribution, they consistently fail to generalize to early GAs due to significant anatomical changes in both mother and fetus across gestation, as well as the difficulty of obtaining annotated early GA EPI data. In this work, we develop a cross-population data augmentation framework that enables pose estimation models to robustly generalize to younger GA clinical cohorts using only annotated images from older GA cohorts. Specifically, we introduce a fetal-specific augmentation strategy that simulates the distinct intrauterine environment and fetal positioning of early GAs. Our experiments find that cross-population augmentation yields reduced variability and significant improvements across both older GA and challenging early GA cases. By enabling more reliable pose estimation across gestation, our work potentially facilitates early clinical detection and intervention in challenging 4D fetal imaging settings. Code is available at https://github.com/sebodiaz/cross-population-pose.</p></details> | Accepted MICCAI 2025 |
| **[Quantum Noise Tomography with Physics-Informed Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11911v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Characterizing the environmental interactions of quantum systems is a critical bottleneck in the development of robust quantum technologies. Traditional tomographic methods are often data-intensive and struggle with scalability. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for performing Lindblad tomography using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). By embedding the Lindblad master equation directly into the neural network's loss function, our approach simultaneously learns the quantum state's evolution and infers the underlying dissipation parameters from sparse, time-series measurement data. Our results show that PINNs can reconstruct both the system dynamics and the functional form of unknown noise parameters, presenting a sample-efficient and scalable solution for quantum device characterization. Ultimately, our method produces a fully-differentiable digital twin of a noisy quantum system by learning its governing master equation.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences Workshop at the 39th conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS)</p></details> |
| **[Wavelet-SARIMA-Transformer: A Hybrid Model for Rainfall Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11903v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study develops and evaluates a novel hybridWavelet SARIMA Transformer, WST framework to forecast using monthly rainfall across five meteorological subdivisions of Northeast India over the 1971 to 2023 period. The approach employs the Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform, MODWT with four wavelet families such as, Haar, Daubechies, Symlet, Coiflet etc. to achieve shift invariant, multiresolution decomposition of the rainfall series. Linear and seasonal components are modeled using Seasonal ARIMA, SARIMA, while nonlinear components are modeled by a Transformer network, and forecasts are reconstructed via inverse MODWT. Comprehensive validation using an 80 is to 20 train test split and multiple performance indices such as, RMSE, MAE, SMAPE, Willmotts d, Skill Score, Percent Bias, Explained Variance, and Legates McCabes E1 demonstrates the superiority of the Haar-based hybrid model, WHST. Across all subdivisions, WHST consistently achieved lower forecast errors, stronger agreement with observed rainfall, and unbiased predictions compared with stand alone SARIMA, stand-alone Transformer, and two-stage wavelet hybrids. Residual adequacy was confirmed through the Ljung Box test, while Taylor diagrams provided an integrated assessment of correlation, variance fidelity, and RMSE, further reinforcing the robustness of the proposed approach. The results highlight the effectiveness of integrating multiresolution signal decomposition with complementary linear and deep learning models for hydroclimatic forecasting. Beyond rainfall, the proposed WST framework offers a scalable methodology for forecasting complex environmental time series, with direct implications for flood risk management, water resources planning, and climate adaptation strategies in data-sparse and climate-sensitive regions.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Path Signature Framework for Detecting Creative Fatigue in Digital Advertising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09758v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel framework for detecting advertising creative fatigue using path signature analysis, a geometric approach from rough path theory not previously applied in marketing. Creative fatigue - the decline in advertising effectiveness over time - poses a major risk to digital media spend. Our method transforms performance time-series into geometric paths, extracting high-dimensional signatures to capture complex dynamics: volatility shifts, trend reversals, and non-linear decay. Unlike traditional statistical methods, this approach detects subtle, multi-scale changes. We validate the framework using synthetic datasets replicating documented fatigue patterns from marketing literature. Results show superior early detection, enabling actionable insights before significant budget loss. A novel financial impact model quantifies opportunity costs from delayed detection, while computational analysis confirms linear scalability for real-time monitoring of large creative portfolios.</p></details> | version 2 |
| **[TemporalFED: Detecting Cyberattacks in Industrial Time-Series Data Using Decentralized Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03554v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industry 4.0 has brought numerous advantages, such as increasing productivity through automation. However, it also presents major cybersecurity issues such as cyberattacks affecting industrial processes. Federated Learning (FL) combined with time-series analysis is a promising cyberattack detection mechanism proposed in the literature. However, the fact of having a single point of failure and network bottleneck are critical challenges that need to be tackled. Thus, this article explores the benefits of the Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) in terms of cyberattack detection and resource consumption. The work presents TemporalFED, a software module for detecting anomalies in industrial environments using FL paradigms and time series. TemporalFED incorporates three components: Time Series Conversion, Feature Engineering, and Time Series Stationary Conversion. To evaluate TemporalFED, it was deployed on Fedstellar, a DFL framework. Then, a pool of experiments measured the detection performance and resource consumption in a chemical gas industrial environment with different time-series configurations, FL paradigms, and topologies. The results showcase the superiority of the configuration utilizing DFL and Semi-Decentralized Federated Learning (SDFL) paradigms, along with a fully connected topology, which achieved the best performance in anomaly detection. Regarding resource consumption, the configuration without feature engineering employed less bandwidth, CPU, and RAM than other configurations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Topology Structure Optimization of Reservoirs Using GLMY Homology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11612v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reservoir is an efficient network for time series processing. It is well known that network structure is one of the determinants of its performance. However, the topology structure of reservoirs, as well as their performance, is hard to analyzed, due to the lack of suitable mathematical tools. In this paper, we study the topology structure of reservoirs using persistent GLMY homology theory, and develop a method to improve its performance. Specifically, it is found that the reservoir performance is closely related to the one-dimensional GLMY homology groups. Then, we develop a reservoir structure optimization method by modifying the minimal representative cycles of one-dimensional GLMY homology groups. Finally, by experiments, it is validated that the performance of reservoirs is jointly influenced by the reservoir structure and the periodicity of the dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of Reasoning and Agentic Systems in Time Series with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11575v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series reasoning treats time as a first-class axis and incorporates intermediate evidence directly into the answer. This survey defines the problem and organizes the literature by reasoning topology with three families: direct reasoning in one step, linear chain reasoning with explicit intermediates, and branch-structured reasoning that explores, revises, and aggregates. The topology is crossed with the main objectives of the field, including traditional time series analysis, explanation and understanding, causal inference and decision making, and time series generation, while a compact tag set spans these axes and captures decomposition and verification, ensembling, tool use, knowledge access, multimodality, agent loops, and LLM alignment regimes. Methods and systems are reviewed across domains, showing what each topology enables and where it breaks down in faithfulness or robustness, along with curated datasets, benchmarks, and resources that support study and deployment (https://github.com/blacksnail789521/Time-Series-Reasoning-Survey). Evaluation practices that keep evidence visible and temporally aligned are highlighted, and guidance is distilled on matching topology to uncertainty, grounding with observable artifacts, planning for shift and streaming, and treating cost and latency as design budgets. We emphasize that reasoning structures must balance capacity for grounding and self-correction against computational cost and reproducibility, while future progress will likely depend on benchmarks that tie reasoning quality to utility and on closed-loop testbeds that trade off cost and risk under shift-aware, streaming, and long-horizon settings. Taken together, these directions mark a shift from narrow accuracy toward reliability at scale, enabling systems that not only analyze but also understand, explain, and act on dynamic worlds with traceable evidence and credible outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review</p></details> |
| **[Association between Air Pollutants and Hospitalizations for Cardiovascular Diseases: Time-Series Analysis in São Paulo, 2010-2019](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11546v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) remain one of the leading causes of hospitalization in Brazil. Exposure to air pollutants such as PM$_{10}$ $\mu$m, NO$_2$, and SO$_2$ has been associated with the worsening of these diseases, especially in urban areas. This study evaluated the association between the daily concentration of these pollutants and daily hospitalizations for acute myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular diseases in S\~ao Paulo (2010-2019), using generalized additive models with a lag of 0 to 4 days. Two approaches for choosing the degrees of freedom in temporal smoothing were compared: based on pollutant prediction and based on outcome prediction (hospitalizations). Data were obtained from official government databases. The modeling used the quasi-Poisson family in R software (v. 4.4.0). Models with exposure-based smoothing generated more consistent estimates. For PM10{\mu}m, the cumulative risk estimate for exposure was 1.08%, while for hospitalization, it was 1.20%. For NO$_2$, the estimated risk was 1.47% (exposure) versus 1.33% (hospitalization). For SO$_2$, a striking difference was observed: 7.66% (exposure) versus 14.31% (hospitalization). The significant lags were on days 0, 1, and 2. The results show that smoothing based on outcome prediction can generate bias, masking the true effect of pollutants. The appropriate choice of df in the smoothing function is crucial. Smoothing by the pollutant series was more robust and accurate, contributing to methodological improvements in time-series studies and reinforcing the importance of public policies for pollution control.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages with 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Trading-R1: Financial Trading with LLM Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11420v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing professional, structured reasoning on par with human financial analysts and traders remains a central challenge in AI for finance, where markets demand interpretability and trust. Traditional time-series models lack explainability, while LLMs face challenges in turning natural-language analysis into disciplined, executable trades. Although reasoning LLMs have advanced in step-by-step planning and verification, their application to risk-sensitive financial decisions is underexplored. We present Trading-R1, a financially-aware model that incorporates strategic thinking and planning for comprehensive thesis composition, facts-grounded analysis, and volatility-adjusted decision making. Trading-R1 aligns reasoning with trading principles through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with a three-stage easy-to-hard curriculum. Training uses Tauric-TR1-DB, a 100k-sample corpus spanning 18 months, 14 equities, and five heterogeneous financial data sources. Evaluated on six major equities and ETFs, Trading-R1 demonstrates improved risk-adjusted returns and lower drawdowns compared to both open-source and proprietary instruction-following models as well as reasoning models. The system generates structured, evidence-based investment theses that support disciplined and interpretable trading decisions. Trading-R1 Terminal will be released at https://github.com/TauricResearch/Trading-R1.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tauri...</summary><p>Tauric Research: https://github.com/TauricResearch</p></details> |
| **[Improved Classification of Nitrogen Stress Severity in Plants Under Combined Stress Conditions Using Spatio-Temporal Deep Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06625v2)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Plants in their natural habitats endure an array of interacting stresses, both biotic and abiotic, that rarely occur in isolation. Nutrient stress-particularly nitrogen deficiency-becomes even more critical when compounded with drought and weed competition, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish and address its effects. Early detection of nitrogen stress is therefore crucial for protecting plant health and implementing effective management strategies. This study proposes a novel deep learning framework to accurately classify nitrogen stress severity in a combined stress environment. Our model uses a unique blend of four imaging modalities-RGB, multispectral, and two infrared wavelengths-to capture a wide range of physiological plant responses from canopy images. These images, provided as time-series data, document plant health across three levels of nitrogen availability (low, medium, and high) under varying water stress and weed pressures. The core of our approach is a spatio-temporal deep learning pipeline that merges a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for extracting spatial features from images with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture temporal dependencies. We also devised and evaluated a spatial-only CNN pipeline for comparison. Our CNN-LSTM pipeline achieved an impressive accuracy of 98%, impressively surpassing the spatial-only model's 80.45% and other previously reported machine learning method's 76%. These results bring actionable insights based on the power of our CNN-LSTM approach in effectively capturing the subtle and complex interactions between nitrogen deficiency, water stress, and weed pressure. This robust platform offers a promising tool for the timely and proactive identification of nitrogen stress severity, enabling better crop management and improved plant health.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, 7 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Next-Generation Reservoir Computing for Dynamical Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11338v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a simple and scalable implementation of next-generation reservoir computing for modeling dynamical systems from time series data. Our approach uses a pseudorandom nonlinear projection of time-delay embedded input, allowing an arbitrary dimension of the feature space, thus providing a flexible alternative to the polynomial-based projections used in previous next-generation reservoir computing variants. We apply the method to benchmark tasks -- including attractor reconstruction and bifurcation diagram estimation -- using only partial and noisy observations. We also include an exploratory example of estimating asymptotic oscillation phases. The models remain stable over long rollouts and generalize beyond training data. This framework enables the precise control of system state and is well suited for surrogate modeling and digital twin applications.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Parameter estimation for fractional autoregressive process with periodic structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20736v2)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a new periodic fractional autoregressive process (PFAR) driven by fractional Gaussian noise (fGn) to model time series of precipitation evapotranspiration. Compared with the similar model in [\emph{Water Resources Research}, \textbf{20} (1984) 1898--1908], the new model incorporates a periodic structure via specialized varying coefficients and captures long memory and rough voltality through fGn for $0<H<1$, rather than via fractional differencing. In this work, Generalized Least Squares Estimation (GLSE) and the GPH method are employed to construct an initial estimator for the joint estimation of model parameters. A One-Step procedure is then used to obtain a more asymptotically efficient estimator. The paper proves that both estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal, and their performance is demonstrated via Monte Carlo simulations with finite-size samples. Simulation studies suggest that, while both estimation methods can accurately estimate the model parameters, the One-Step estimator outperforms the initial estimator.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rumor Detection by Multi-task Suffix Learning based on Time-series Dual Sentiments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14383v2)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread dissemination of rumors on social media has a significant impact on people's lives, potentially leading to public panic and fear. Rumors often evoke specific sentiments, resonating with readers and prompting sharing. To effectively detect and track rumors, it is essential to observe the fine-grained sentiments of both source and response message pairs as the rumor evolves over time. However, current rumor detection methods fail to account for this aspect. In this paper, we propose MSuf, the first multi-task suffix learning framework for rumor detection and tracking using time series dual (coupled) sentiments. MSuf includes three modules: (1) an LLM to extract sentiment intensity features and sort them chronologically; (2) a module that fuses the sorted sentiment features with their source text word embeddings to obtain an aligned embedding; (3) two hard prompts are combined with the aligned vector to perform rumor detection and sentiment analysis using one frozen LLM. MSuf effectively enhances the performance of LLMs for rumor detection with only minimal parameter fine-tuning. Evaluating MSuf on four rumor detection benchmarks, we find significant improvements compared to other emotion-based methods.</p></details> | work in progress |
| **[Learning Chaotic Dynamics with Neuromorphic Network Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10773v2)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates how dynamical systems may be learned and modelled with a neuromorphic network which is itself a dynamical system. The neuromorphic network used in this study is based on a complex electrical circuit comprised of memristive elements that produce neuro-synaptic nonlinear responses to input electrical signals. To determine how computation may be performed using the physics of the underlying system, the neuromorphic network was simulated and evaluated on autonomous prediction of a multivariate chaotic time series, implemented with a reservoir computing framework. Through manipulating only input electrodes and voltages, optimal nonlinear dynamical responses were found when input voltages maximise the number of memristive components whose internal dynamics explore the entire dynamical range of the memristor model. Increasing the network coverage with the input electrodes was found to suppress other nonlinear responses that are less conducive to learning. These results provide valuable insights into how a physical neuromorphic network device can be feasibly optimised for learning complex dynamical systems using only external control parameters.</p></details> | 42 pages, 24 figures |
| **[Maximum diversity, weighting and invariants of time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11146v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Magnitude, obtained as a special case of Euler characteristic of enriched category, represents a sense of the size of metric spaces and is related to classical notions such as cardinality, dimension, and volume. While the studies have explained the meaning of magnitude from various perspectives, continuity also gives a valuable view of magnitude. Based on established results about continuity of magnitude and maximum diversity, this article focuses on continuity of weighting, a distribution whose totality is magnitude, and its variation corresponding to maximum diversity. Meanwhile, recent studies also illuminated the connection between magnitude and data analysis by applying magnitude theory to point clouds representing the data or the set of model parameters. This article will also provide an application for time series analysis by introducing a new kind of invariants of periodic time series, where the invariance follows directly from the continuity results. As a use-case, a simple machine learning experiment is conducted with real-world data, in which the suggested invariants improved the performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[FEWT: Improving Humanoid Robot Perception with Frequency-Enhanced Wavelet-based Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11109v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The embodied intelligence bridges the physical world and information space. As its typical physical embodiment, humanoid robots have shown great promise through robot learning algorithms in recent years. In this study, a hardware platform, including humanoid robot and exoskeleton-style teleoperation cabin, was developed to realize intuitive remote manipulation and efficient collection of anthropomorphic action data. To improve the perception representation of humanoid robot, an imitation learning framework, termed Frequency-Enhanced Wavelet-based Transformer (FEWT), was proposed, which consists of two primary modules: Frequency-Enhanced Efficient Multi-Scale Attention (FE-EMA) and Time-Series Discrete Wavelet Transform (TS-DWT). By combining multi-scale wavelet decomposition with the residual network, FE-EMA can dynamically fuse features from both time-domain and frequency-domain. This fusion is able to capture feature information across various scales effectively, thereby enhancing model robustness. Experimental performance demonstrates that FEWT improves the success rate of the state-of-the-art algorithm (Action Chunking with Transformers, ACT baseline) by up to 30% in simulation and by 6-12% in real-world.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large-Scale Curve Time Series with Common Stochastic Trends](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11060v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies high-dimensional curve time series with common stochastic trends. A dual functional factor model structure is adopted with a high-dimensional factor model for the observed curve time series and a low-dimensional factor model for the latent curves with common trends. A functional PCA technique is applied to estimate the common stochastic trends and functional factor loadings. Under some regularity conditions we derive the mean square convergence and limit distribution theory for the developed estimates, allowing the dimension and sample size to jointly diverge to infinity. We propose an easy-to-implement criterion to consistently select the number of common stochastic trends and further discuss model estimation when the nonstationary factors are cointegrated. Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations and two empirical applications to large-scale temperature curves in Australia and log-price curves of S&P 500 stocks are conducted, showing finite-sample performance and providing practical implementations of the new methodology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Learning based Moving Target Defence for Federated Learning against Poisoning Attack in MEC Systems with a 6G Wireless Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10914v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaboration opportunities for devices are facilitated with Federated Learning (FL). Edge computing facilitates aggregation at edge and reduces latency. To deal with model poisoning attacks, model-based outlier detection mechanisms may not operate efficiently with hetereogenous models or in recognition of complex attacks. This paper fosters the defense line against model poisoning attack by exploiting device-level traffic analysis to anticipate the reliability of participants. FL is empowered with a topology mutation strategy, as a Moving Target Defence (MTD) strategy to dynamically change the participants in learning. Based on the adoption of recurrent neural networks for time-series analysis of traffic and a 6G wireless model, optimization framework for MTD strategy is given. A deep reinforcement mechanism is provided to optimize topology mutation in adaption with the anticipated Byzantine status of devices and the communication channel capabilities at devices. For a DDoS attack detection application and under Botnet attack at devices level, results illustrate acceptable malicious models exclusion and improvement in recognition time and accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Branched Broomrape Detection in Tomato Farms Using Satellite Imagery and Time-Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10804v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Branched broomrape (Phelipanche ramosa (L.) Pomel) is a chlorophyll-deficient parasitic plant that threatens tomato production by extracting nutrients from the host, with reported yield losses up to 80 percent. Its mostly subterranean life cycle and prolific seed production (more than 200,000 seeds per plant, viable for up to 20 years) make early detection essential. We present an end-to-end pipeline that uses Sentinel-2 imagery and time-series analysis to identify broomrape-infested tomato fields in California. Regions of interest were defined from farmer-reported infestations, and images with less than 10 percent cloud cover were retained. We processed 12 spectral bands and sun-sensor geometry, computed 20 vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI, NDMI), and derived five plant traits (Leaf Area Index, Leaf Chlorophyll Content, Canopy Chlorophyll Content, Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation, and Fractional Vegetation Cover) using a neural network calibrated with ground-truth and synthetic data. Trends in Canopy Chlorophyll Content delineated transplanting-to-harvest periods, and phenology was aligned using growing degree days. Vegetation pixels were segmented and used to train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network on 18,874 pixels across 48 growing-degree-day time points. The model achieved 88 percent training accuracy and 87 percent test accuracy, with precision 0.86, recall 0.92, and F1 0.89. Permutation feature importance ranked NDMI, Canopy Chlorophyll Content, FAPAR, and a chlorophyll red-edge index as most informative, consistent with the physiological effects of infestation. Results show the promise of satellite-driven time-series modeling for scalable detection of parasitic stress in tomato farms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Author-accepted version.

| **[Why Bonds Fail Differently? Explainable Multimodal Learning for Multi-Class Default Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10802v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, China's bond market has seen a surge in defaults amid regulatory reforms and macroeconomic volatility. Traditional machine learning models struggle to capture financial data's irregularity and temporal dependencies, while most deep learning models lack interpretability-critical for financial decision-making. To tackle these issues, we propose EMDLOT (Explainable Multimodal Deep Learning for Time-series), a novel framework for multi-class bond default prediction. EMDLOT integrates numerical time-series (financial/macroeconomic indicators) and unstructured textual data (bond prospectuses), uses Time-Aware LSTM to handle irregular sequences, and adopts soft clustering and multi-level attention to boost interpretability. Experiments on 1994 Chinese firms (2015-2024) show EMDLOT outperforms traditional (e.g., XGBoost) and deep learning (e.g., LSTM) benchmarks in recall, F1-score, and mAP, especially in identifying default/extended firms. Ablation studies validate each component's value, and attention analyses reveal economically intuitive default drivers. This work provides a practical tool and a trustworthy framework for transparent financial risk modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using LLMs for Late Multimodal Sensor Fusion for Activity Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10729v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sensor data streams provide valuable information around activities and context for downstream applications, though integrating complementary information can be challenging. We show that large language models (LLMs) can be used for late fusion for activity classification from audio and motion time series data. We curated a subset of data for diverse activity recognition across contexts (e.g., household activities, sports) from the Ego4D dataset. Evaluated LLMs achieved 12-class zero- and one-shot classification F1-scores significantly above chance, with no task-specific training. Zero-shot classification via LLM-based fusion from modality-specific models can enable multimodal temporal applications where there is limited aligned training data for learning a shared embedding space. Additionally, LLM-based fusion can enable model deploying without requiring additional memory and computation for targeted application-specific multimodal models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under review</p></details> |
| **[Continuum Attention for Neural Operators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06486v3)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers, and the attention mechanism in particular, have become ubiquitous in machine learning. Their success in modeling nonlocal, long-range correlations has led to their widespread adoption in natural language processing, computer vision, and time series problems. Neural operators, which map spaces of functions into spaces of functions, are necessarily both nonlinear and nonlocal if they are universal; it is thus natural to ask whether the attention mechanism can be used in the design of neural operators. Motivated by this, we study transformers in the function space setting. We formulate attention as a map between infinite dimensional function spaces and prove that the attention mechanism as implemented in practice is a Monte Carlo or finite difference approximation of this operator. The function space formulation allows for the design of transformer neural operators, a class of architectures designed to learn mappings between function spaces. In this paper, we state and prove the first universal approximation result for transformer neural operators, using only a slight modification of the architecture implemented in practice. The prohibitive cost of applying the attention operator to functions defined on multi-dimensional domains leads to the need for more efficient attention-based architectures. For this reason we also introduce a function space generalization of the patching strategy from computer vision, and introduce a class of associated neural operators. Numerical results, on an array of operator learning problems, demonstrate the promise of our approaches to function space formulations of attention and their use in neural operators.</p></details> |  |

However, when such models are applied directly to under-reported case counts, their mechanistic interpretation can break down. We establish new theoretical results quantifying the consequences of ignoring under-reporting in these models. To address this issue, reported cases are often modelled as a binomially thinned version of an underlying count process, but such models are difficult to fit because the unobserved true counts are serially correlated and integer-valued. We develop a new statistical framework for under-reported infectious-disease data that uses a normal-normal approximation to a broad class of thinned count autoregressions and then accurately maps this continuous process back to the integers. Through simulations and applications to rotavirus incidence in a German state and Covid-19 incidence in English conurbations, we demonstrate that our approach both retains the mechanistic appeal of thinned autoregressions and substantially simplifies inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advanced Hybrid Transformer LSTM Technique with Attention and TS Mixer for Drilling Rate of Penetration Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05210v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of the Rate of Penetration (ROP) is pivotal for drilling optimization, yet it remains a persistent challenge due to the nonlinear, dynamic, and heterogeneous nature of drilling data. This study introduces a novel hybrid deep learning architecture in which input data are first processed through a customized Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture multi-scale temporal dependencies aligned with drilling operational cycles, and the resulting features are subsequently refined by an Enhanced Transformer encoder with drilling-specific positional encodings and real-time optimization. Concurrently, the same input is directed to a Time-Series Mixer (TS-Mixer) block that enables efficient cross-feature modeling of static and categorical attributes such as lithology indices and mud properties. The outputs from the enhanced Transformer and TS-Mixer are concatenated, after which an adaptive attention selectively emphasizes the most informative feature representations for accurate ROP prediction. The proposed framework fuses sequential memory, static feature interactions, global contextual learning, and dynamic feature weighting, providing a comprehensive solution to the heterogeneous and event-driven nature of drilling dynamics. Evaluation on a real-world drilling dataset demonstrates benchmark-leading performance, achieving an Rsqaure of 0.9988 and a MAPE of 1.447%, significantly surpassing standalone and hybrid baselines. Model interpretability is achieved through SHAP and LIME, and comparisons between actual and predicted curves, along with bias checks, confirm the accuracy and fairness of the model across various scenarios. This advanced hybrid approach enables dependable real-time ROP prediction, supporting the development of intelligent, cost-effective drilling optimization systems with significant operational benefits.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 Pa...</summary><p>35 Pages, 19 Figures, 9 Tables</p></details> |

In particular, signature kernels have emerged as powerful discriminators and training losses for generative models on time-series, notably in quantitative finance. However, existing implementations do not scale to the dataset sizes and sequence lengths encountered in practice. We present pySigLib, a high-performance Python library offering optimised implementations of signatures and signature kernels on CPU and GPU, fully compatible with PyTorch's automatic differentiation. Beyond an efficient software stack for large-scale signature-based computation, we introduce a novel differentiation scheme for signature kernels that delivers accurate gradients at a fraction of the runtime of existing libraries.</p></details> |  |

The proposed block, inspired by the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, consists of two convolutional components: one for capturing the trend (autoregression) and the other for refining local variations (moving average). Unlike conventional ARIMA, which requires iterative multi-step forecasting, the block directly performs multi-step forecasting, making it easily extendable to multivariate settings. Experiments on nine widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method ARMA achieves competitive accuracy, particularly on datasets exhibiting strong trend variations, while maintaining architectural simplicity. Furthermore, analysis shows that the block inherently encodes absolute positional information, suggesting its potential as a lightweight replacement for positional embeddings in sequential models.</p></details> |  |

While numerous efforts have substantially advanced the large-scale modeling of hazard and exposure through Earth observation and data-driven methods, progress remains limited in modeling another equally important yet challenging element of the risk equation: physical vulnerability. To address this gap, we introduce Graph Categorical Structured Variational Autoencoder (GraphCSVAE), a novel probabilistic data-driven framework for modeling physical vulnerability by integrating deep learning, graph representation, and categorical probabilistic inference, using time-series satellite-derived datasets and prior expert belief systems. We introduce a weakly supervised first-order transition matrix that reflects the changes in the spatiotemporal distribution of physical vulnerability in two disaster-stricken and socioeconomically disadvantaged areas: (1) the cyclone-impacted coastal Khurushkul community in Bangladesh and (2) the mudslide-affected city of Freetown in Sierra Leone. Our work reveals post-disaster regional dynamics in physical vulnerability, offering valuable insights into localized spatiotemporal auditing and sustainable strategies for post-disaster risk reduction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted full paper at the 8th International Disaster and Risk Conference, IDRC 2025 | Keywords: weakly supervised, graph deep learning, categorical distribution, physical vulnerability, remote sensing, spatiotemporal disaster risk, transition matrix | The data and code are respectively available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16656471 and https://github.com/riskaudit/GraphCSVAE</p></details> |

This study first quantifies the periodicity in complex human mobility data as a sparse identification of dominant positive auto-correlations in time series autoregression and then discovers periodic patterns. We apply the framework to large-scale metro passenger flow data in Hangzhou, China and multi-modal mobility data in New York City and Chicago, USA, revealing the interpretable weekly periodicity across different spatial locations over past several years. The analysis of ridesharing data from 2019 to 2024 demonstrates the disruptive impact of the pandemic on mobility regularity and the subsequent recovery trends. In 2024, the periodic mobility patterns of ridesharing, taxi, subway, and bikesharing in Manhattan uncover the regularity and variability of these travel modes. Our findings highlight the potential of interpretable machine learning to discover spatiotemporal mobility patterns and offer a valuable tool for understanding urban systems.</p></details> |  |

Reservoir computing (RC) has drawn attention as an RNN framework due to its fixed network that does not require training, making it an attractive platform for hardware based machine learning. We establish an explicit correspondence between the well-established mathematical RC implementations of Echo State Networks and Band-pass Networks with Leaky Integrator nodes on the one hand and a physical circuit containing iontronic simple volatile memristors on the other. These aqueous iontronic devices employ ion transport through water as signal carriers, and feature a voltage-dependent (memory) conductance. The activation function and the dynamics of the Leaky Integrator nodes naturally materialise as the (dynamic) conductance properties of iontronic memristors, while a simple fixed local current-to-voltage update rule at the memristor terminals facilitates the relevant matrix coupling between nodes. We process various time series, including pressure data from simulated airways during breathing that can be directly fed into the network due to the intrinsic responsiveness of iontronic devices to applied pressures. We accomplish this by employing established physical equations of motion of iontronic memristors for the internal dynamics of the circuit.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents MAESTRO (Multi-modal Adaptive Estimation for Temporal Respiratory Disease Outbreak), a novel, unified framework that synergistically integrates advanced spectro-temporal modeling with multi-modal data fusion, including surveillance, web search trends, and meteorological data. By adaptively weighting heterogeneous data sources and decomposing complex time series patterns, the model achieves robust and accurate forecasts. Evaluated on over 11 years of Hong Kong influenza data (excluding the COVID-19 period), MAESTRO demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving a superior model fit with an R-square of 0.956. Extensive ablations confirm the significant contributions of its multi-modal and spectro-temporal components. The modular and reproducible pipeline is made publicly available to facilitate deployment and extension to other regions and pathogens, presenting a powerful tool for epidemiological forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multivariate Long-term Time Series Forecasting with Fourier Neural Filter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09174v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate long-term time series forecasting has been suffering from the challenge of capturing both temporal dependencies within variables and spatial correlations across variables simultaneously. Current approaches predominantly repurpose backbones from natural language processing or computer vision (e.g., Transformers), which fail to adequately address the unique properties of time series (e.g., periodicity). The research community lacks a dedicated backbone with temporal-specific inductive biases, instead relying on domain-agnostic backbones supplemented with auxiliary techniques (e.g., signal decomposition). We introduce FNF as the backbone and DBD as the architecture to provide excellent learning capabilities and optimal learning pathways for spatio-temporal modeling, respectively. Our theoretical analysis proves that FNF unifies local time-domain and global frequency-domain information processing within a single backbone that extends naturally to spatial modeling, while information bottleneck theory demonstrates that DBD provides superior gradient flow and representation capacity compared to existing unified or sequential architectures. Our empirical evaluation across 11 public benchmark datasets spanning five domains (energy, meteorology, transportation, environment, and nature) confirms state-of-the-art performance with consistent hyperparameter settings. Notably, our approach achieves these results without any auxiliary techniques, suggesting that properly designed neural architectures can capture the inherent properties of time series, potentially transforming time series modeling in scientific and industrial applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sparse Coding Representation of 2-way Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10033v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse dictionary coding represents signals as linear combinations of a few dictionary atoms. It has been applied to images, time series, graph signals and multi-way spatio-temporal data by jointly employing temporal and spatial dictionaries. Data-agnostic analytical dictionaries, such as the discrete Fourier transform, wavelets and graph Fourier, have seen wide adoption due to efficient implementations and good practical performance. On the other hand, dictionaries learned from data offer sparser and more accurate solutions but require learning of both the dictionaries and the coding coefficients. This becomes especially challenging for multi-dictionary scenarios since encoding coefficients correspond to all atom combinations from the dictionaries. To address this challenge, we propose a low-rank coding model for 2-dictionary scenarios and study its data complexity. Namely, we establish a bound on the number of samples needed to learn dictionaries that generalize to unseen samples from the same distribution. We propose a convex relaxation solution, called AODL, whose exact solution we show also solves the original problem. We then solve this relaxation via alternating optimization between the sparse coding matrices and the learned dictionaries, which we prove to be convergent. We demonstrate its quality for data reconstruction and missing value imputation in both synthetic and real-world datasets. For a fixed reconstruction quality, AODL learns up to 90\% sparser solutions compared to non-low-rank and analytical (fixed) dictionary baselines. In addition, the learned dictionaries reveal interpretable insights into patterns present within the samples used for training.</p></details> |  |

Accurate radiation dose estimation tailored to individual patients is crucial. Deep learning, particularly with pre-therapy imaging, holds promise for personalizing TRT doses. However, current methods require large time series of SPECT imaging, which is hardly achievable in routine clinical practice, and thus raises issues of data availability. Our objective is to develop a semi-supervised learning (SSL) solution to personalize dosimetry using pre-therapy images. The aim is to develop an approach that achieves accurate results when PET/CT images are available, but are associated with only a few post-therapy dosimetry data provided by SPECT images. In this work, we introduce an SSL method using a pseudo-label generation approach for regression tasks inspired by the FixMatch framework. The feasibility of the proposed solution was preliminarily evaluated through an in-silico study using synthetic data and Monte Carlo simulation. Experimental results for organ dose prediction yielded promising outcomes, showing that the use of pseudo-labeled data provides better accuracy compared to using only labeled data.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 13 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Confidence Intervals for Extinction Risk: Validating Population Viability Analysis with Limited Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09965v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantitative assessment of extinction risk requires not only point estimates but also confidence intervals (CIs) that remain informative with limited data. Their reliability has been debated, as short observation spans can inflate uncertainty and reduce usefulness. I derive new CIs for extinction probability $G$ under the Wiener process with drift, a canonical model of population viability analysis. The method uses correlated noncentral-$t$ distributions for the transformed statistics $\widehat{w}$ and $\widehat{z}$, derived from drift and variance estimators, and constructs CIs of the extinction probability by exploiting the geometric properties of $G(\widehat{w},\widehat{z})$ in parameter space. Monte Carlo experiments show that the proposed intervals attain nominal coverage with narrower widths than common approximate methods, including the delta method, moment-based approaches, and bootstrap. A key result is that even with short time series, extinction probabilities that are very small or very large can be estimated reliably. This resolves a long-standing concern that population viability analysis fails under data scarcity. Applied to three 64-year catch series for Japanese eel (Anguilla japonica), the analysis indicates extinction risk well below the IUCN Criterion E thresholds for Critically Endangered and Endangered, with narrow CIs. These findings demonstrate that extinction-risk CIs can be both statistically rigorous and practical for Red List evaluations, even when data are limited.</p></details> | <details><summary>63 pa...</summary><p>63 pages total (including appendix), 17 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Our methodology includes preprocessing meteorological features, implementing QML architectures for both classification and regression tasks. The results demonstrate that QML models can achieve reasonable accuracy in both prediction and classification tasks, particularly in binary classification. However, challenges such as quantum hardware limitations and noise affect scalability and generalization. This research provides insights into the feasibility of QML for weather prediction, paving the way for further exploration of hybrid quantum-classical frameworks to enhance meteorological forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Will ...</summary><p>Will require more permissions and data to be republished later for academic rigor</p></details> |

However, the recent works tend to construct complex learning mechanisms with redundant training and exist a bottleneck for long time-series. To solve these problems, we propose the Temporal-Spatio Graph ConvNeXt (TSGCNeXt) to explore efficient learning mechanism of long temporal skeleton sequences. Firstly, a new graph learning mechanism with simple structure, Dynamic-Static Separate Multi-graph Convolution (DS-SMG) is proposed to aggregate features of multiple independent topological graphs and avoid the node information being ignored during dynamic convolution. Next, we construct a graph convolution training acceleration mechanism to optimize the back-propagation computing of dynamic graph learning with 55.08\% speed-up. Finally, the TSGCNeXt restructure the overall structure of GCN with three Spatio-temporal learning modules,efficiently modeling long temporal features. In comparison with existing previous methods on large-scale datasets NTU RGB+D 60 and 120, TSGCNeXt outperforms on single-stream networks. In addition, with the ema model introduced into the multi-stream fusion, TSGCNeXt achieves SOTA levels. On the cross-subject and cross-set of the NTU 120, accuracies reach 90.22% and 91.74%.</p></details> |  |
| **[A study of the Antlion Random Walk](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12775v3)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Random walks (RWs) are fundamental stochastic processes with applications across physics, computer science, and information processing. A recent extension, the laser chaos decision-maker, employs chaotic time series from semiconductor lasers to solve multi-armed bandit (MAB) problems at ultrafast speeds, and its threshold adjustment mechanism has been modeled as an RW. However, previous analyses assumed complete memory preservation ($\alpha = 1$), overlooking the role of partial memory in balancing exploration and exploitation. In this paper, we introduce the Antlion Random Walk (ARW), defined by $X_t = \alpha X_{t-1} + \xi_t$ with $\alpha \in [0,1]$ and Rademacher-distributed increments $(\xi_t)$, which describes a walker pulled back toward the origin before each step. We show that varying $\alpha$ significantly alters ARW dynamics, yielding distributions that range from uniform-like to normal-like. Through mathematical and numerical analyses, we investigate expectation, variance, reachability, positive-side residence time, and distributional similarity. Our results place ARWs within the framework of autoregressive (AR(1)) processes while highlighting distinct non-Gaussian features, thereby offering new theoretical insights into memory-aware stochastic modeling of decision-making systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages; 7 captioned figures</p></details> |

However, existing methods often rely on point estimates or purely data-driven models, which tend to falter under data scarcity. We propose a time series diffusion-based framework that incorporates guidance from imperfect expert models by extracting high-level signals to serve as structured priors for generative modeling. Our method, ODE-Diff, bridges mechanistic and data-driven approaches, enabling more reliable and interpretable causal inference. We evaluate ODE-Diff across semi-synthetic COVID-19 simulations, synthetic pharmacological dynamics, and real-world case studies, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms strong baselines in both point prediction and distributional accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Sparse regression techniques, exemplified by the Automatic Regression for Governing Equations (ARGOS) framework, have demonstrated effectiveness in extracting parsimonious models from time series data. However, real-world dynamical systems are driven by input control, external forces, or human interventions, which standard ARGOS does not accommodate. To address this, we introduce ARGOS with control (ARGOSc), an extension of ARGOS that incorporates external control inputs into the system identification process. ARGOSc extends the sparse regression framework to infer governing equations while accounting for the effects of exogenous inputs, enabling robust identification of forcing dynamics in low- to medium-noise datasets. We demonstrate ARGOSc efficacy on benchmark systems, including the Van der Pol oscillator, Lotka-Volterra, and the Lorenz system with forcing and feedback control, showing enhanced accuracy in discovering governing laws. Under the noisy conditions, ARGOSc outperforms the widely used sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics with control (SINDYc), in accurately identifying the underlying forced dynamics. In some cases, SINDYc fails to capture the true system dynamics, whereas ARGOSc consistently succeeds.</p></details> |  |

There is a debate about whether Transformers, despite being good at understanding long sequences, struggle with preserving temporal relationships in time series data. Recent research suggests that simpler linear models might outperform or at least provide competitive performance compared to complex Transformer-based models for TSF tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel data-efficient architecture, \textit{Gaussian-activated Linear model (GLinear)}, for multivariate TSF that exploits periodic patterns to provide better accuracy. It achieves higher prediction accuracy while requiring less historical data than other state-of-the-art linear predictors. Four different datasets (ETTh1, Electricity, Traffic, and Weather) are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed predictor. A performance comparison with state-of-the-art linear architectures (such as NLinear, DLinear, and RLinear) and transformer-based time series predictors (Autoformer) shows that the GLinear, despite being data efficient, outperforms the existing architectures in most cases of multivariate TSF while being competitive in others. We hope that the proposed GLinear model opens new fronts of research and development of simpler and more sophisticated architectures for data and computationally efficient time-series analysis.

Despite the progress in deep learning for time series analysis, there remains a challenge in addressing the non-stationary nature of time series data. Traditional models, which are built on the assumption of constant statistical properties over time, often struggle to capture the temporal dynamics in realistic time series, resulting in bias and error in time series analysis. This paper introduces the Adaptive Wavelet Network (AdaWaveNet), a novel approach that employs Adaptive Wavelet Transformation for multi-scale analysis of non-stationary time series data. AdaWaveNet designed a lifting scheme-based wavelet decomposition and construction mechanism for adaptive and learnable wavelet transforms, which offers enhanced flexibility and robustness in analysis. We conduct extensive experiments on 10 datasets across 3 different tasks, including forecasting, imputation, and a newly established super-resolution task.

While significant advances have been made in medical imaging, genetic biomarkers, and time series from electronic health records, the potential of foundation models for patient behavior monitoring through personal digital devices remains underexplored. The data generated by these devices are inherently heterogeneous, multisource, and often exhibit high rates of missing data, posing unique challenges. This paper introduces a novel foundation model based on a modified vector quantized variational autoencoder, specifically designed to process real-world data from smartphones and wearable devices. We leveraged the discrete latent representation of this model to effectively perform two downstream tasks, suicide risk assessment and emotional state prediction, on different held-out clinical cohorts without the need of fine-tuning. We also highlight the existence of a trade-off between discrete and continuous latent structures, suggesting that hybrid models may be optimal for balancing accuracy across various supervised and unsupervised tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages (32 with references and supplementary material).

In this paper, we propose a novel technique called Temporal Query (TQ) to more effectively capture multivariate correlations, thereby improving model performance in MTSF tasks. Technically, the TQ technique employs periodically shifted learnable vectors as queries in the attention mechanism to capture global inter-variable patterns, while the keys and values are derived from the raw input data to encode local, sample-level correlations. Building upon the TQ technique, we develop a simple yet efficient model named Temporal Query Network (TQNet), which employs only a single-layer attention mechanism and a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Extensive experiments demonstrate that TQNet learns more robust multivariate correlations, achieving state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy across 12 challenging real-world datasets. Furthermore, TQNet achieves high efficiency comparable to linear-based methods even on high-dimensional datasets, balancing performance and computational cost.

Recent advances in deep learning and large scale language models (LLMs) have made significant strides in capturing sentiment and other qualitative signals, thereby enhancing the accuracy of financial time series predictions. Despite these advances, most existing datasets consist solely of price series and news text, are confined to a single market, and remain limited in scale. In this paper, we introduce FinMultiTime, the first large scale, multimodal financial time series dataset. FinMultiTime temporally aligns four distinct modalities financial news, structured financial tables, K-line technical charts, and stock price time series across both the S&P 500 and HS 300 universes. Covering 5,105 stocks from 2009 to 2025 in the United States and China, the dataset totals 112.6 GB and provides minute-level, daily, and quarterly resolutions, thus capturing short, medium, and long term market signals with high fidelity. Our experiments demonstrate that (1) scale and data quality markedly boost prediction accuracy; (2) multimodal fusion yields moderate gains in Transformer models; and (3) a fully reproducible pipeline enables seamless dataset updates.</p></details> | Under review |

To overcome these limitations, we introduce a causality-aware deep learning framework that integrates Multivariate Granger Causality (MVGC) and PCMCI+ for causal feature selection within a hybrid neural architecture. Leveraging 43 years (1979-2021) of Arctic Sea Ice Extent (SIE) data and associated ocean-atmospheric variables at daily and monthly resolutions, the proposed method identifies causally influential predictors, prioritizes direct causes of SIE dynamics, reduces unnecessary features, and enhances computational efficiency. Experimental results show that incorporating causal inputs leads to improved prediction accuracy and interpretability across varying lead times. While demonstrated on Arctic SIE forecasting, the framework is broadly applicable to other dynamic, high-dimensional domains, offering a scalable approach that advances both the theoretical foundations and practical performance of causality-informed predictive modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and presented at the AI4TS Workshop @ IJCAI 2025 (non-archival)</p></details> |

This manuscript accounts for temporal dependence in ANOVA and develops a test statistic suitable for high-dimensional, non-stationary time series. Recognizing that the presence of complex fourth-order cumulants may introduce difficulties in variance estimation of the test statistic, we develop a bootstrap algorithm to conduct hypothesis testing through computer simulations. Theoretical results including the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis and the validity of the proposed bootstrap algorithm are established. Numerical studies demonstrate a good finite-sample performance of the proposed test statistic. In addition to the new test procedure, this manuscript derives theoretical results on consistency, Gaussian approximation, and variance estimation for quadratic forms of high-dimensional non-stationary time series, which may be of independent interest to researchers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Reinforcement Learning for Inventory Networks: Toward Reliable Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11246v3)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We argue that inventory management presents unique opportunities for the reliable application of deep reinforcement learning (DRL). To enable this, we emphasize and test two complementary techniques. The first is Hindsight Differentiable Policy Optimization (HDPO), which uses pathwise gradients from offline counterfactual simulations to directly and efficiently optimize policy performance. Unlike standard policy gradient methods that rely on high-variance score-function estimators, HDPO computes gradients by differentiating through the known system dynamics. Via extensive benchmarking, we show that HDPO recovers near-optimal policies in settings with known or bounded optima, is more robust than variants of the REINFORCE algorithm, and significantly outperforms generalized newsvendor heuristics on problems using real time series data. Our second technique aligns neural policy architectures with the topology of the inventory network. We exploit Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as a natural inductive bias for encoding supply chain structure, demonstrate that they can represent optimal and near-optimal policies in two theoretical settings, and empirically show that they reduce data requirements across six diverse inventory problems. A key obstacle to progress in this area is the lack of standardized benchmark problems. To address this gap, we open-source a suite of benchmark environments, along with our full codebase, to promote transparency and reproducibility. All resources are available at github.com/MatiasAlvo/Neural_inventory_control.</p></details> |  |

If comparable volumes could be generated directly from widely available scalp electroencephalography (EEG), advanced neuroimaging would become significantly more accessible. Existing EEG-to-fMRI generators rely on plain Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that fail to capture cross-channel time-frequency cues or on heavy transformer/Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) decoders that strain memory and stability. To address these limitations, we propose Spec2VolCAMU-Net, a lightweight architecture featuring a Multi-directional Time-Frequency Convolutional Attention Encoder for rich feature extraction and a Vision-Mamba U-Net decoder that uses linear-time state-space blocks for efficient long-range spatial modelling. We frame the goal of this work as establishing a new state of the art in the spatial fidelity of single-volume reconstruction, a foundational prerequisite for the ultimate aim of generating temporally coherent fMRI time series. Trained end-to-end with a hybrid SSI-MSE loss, Spec2VolCAMU-Net achieves state-of-the-art fidelity on three public benchmarks, recording Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.693 on NODDI, 0.725 on Oddball and 0.788 on CN-EPFL, representing improvements of 14.5%, 14.9%, and 16.9% respectively over previous best SSIM scores. Furthermore, it achieves competitive Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) scores, particularly excelling on the CN-EPFL dataset with a 4.6% improvement over the previous best PSNR, thus striking a better balance in reconstruction quality. The proposed model is lightweight and efficient, making it suitable for real-time applications in clinical and research settings. The code is available at https://github.com/hdy6438/Spec2VolCAMU-Net.</p></details> |  |

Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is central to detecting cardiac abnormalities, yet challenges such as noise, class imbalance, and dataset heterogeneity limit current methods. To address these issues, we propose FoundationalECGNet, a foundational framework for automated ECG classification. The model integrates a dual-stage denoising by Morlet and Daubechies wavelets transformation, Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and Time Series Transformers (TST) to jointly capture spatial and temporal dependencies in multi-channel ECG signals. FoundationalECGNet first distinguishes between Normal and Abnormal ECG signals, and then classifies the Abnormal signals into one of five cardiac conditions: Arrhythmias, Conduction Disorders, Myocardial Infarction, QT Abnormalities, or Hypertrophy. Across multiple datasets, the model achieves a 99% F1-score for Normal vs. Abnormal classification and shows state-of-the-art performance in multi-class disease detection, including a 99% F1-score for Conduction Disorders and Hypertrophy, as well as a 98.9% F1-score for Arrhythmias. Additionally, the model provides risk level estimations to facilitate clinical decision-making. In conclusion, FoundationalECGNet represents a scalable, interpretable, and generalizable solution for automated ECG analysis, with the potential to improve diagnostic precision and patient outcomes in healthcare settings. We'll share the code after acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Feature Representation and Clustering of Airport Congestion with Hurst Exponent and High Order Statistics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08952v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Air traffic controllers benefit from referencing historical dates with similar complex air traffic conditions to identify potential management measures and their effects, which is critical for understanding air transportation system laws and optimizing decisions. This study conducted data mining using flight timetables. It first explored airport congestion mechanisms and quantified congestion as time series, then proposed a higher-order cumulants based time series feature extraction method. This method was fused with other features to build a high-dimensional airport congestion feature vector, and finally K-means clustering was applied to extract and analyze congestion patterns. The clustering method was empirically validated with 2023 flight data from Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport and it accurately classified airport operational states. To verify universality, the same framework was applied to 6 airports under the "one-city, two-airports" layout in Beijing, Shanghai and Chengdu. Results showed significant congestion pattern differences between existing and newly constructed airports. Conclusions confirm the proposed feature extraction and clustering framework is effective and universal, and it can accurately capture airport congestion dynamics. Under the "one-city, two-airports" layout, existing and newly constructed airports differ significantly in operational modes, and most single-airport city airports have operational modes highly consistent with existing airports. This study provides valuable decision-making references for airport managers and air traffic controllers. It helps them deepen understanding of air traffic dynamics and airport congestion patterns, thereby optimizing traffic management strategies and improving airport operational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[FinZero: Launching Multi-modal Financial Time Series Forecast with Large Reasoning Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08742v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Financial time series forecasting is both highly significant and challenging. Previous approaches typically standardized time series data before feeding it into forecasting models, but this encoding process inherently leads to a loss of important information. Moreover, past time series models generally require fixed numbers of variables or lookback window lengths, which further limits the scalability of time series forecasting. Besides, the interpretability and the uncertainty in forecasting remain areas requiring further research, as these factors directly impact the reliability and practical value of predictions. To address these issues, we first construct a diverse financial image-text dataset (FVLDB) and develop the Uncertainty-adjusted Group Relative Policy Optimization (UARPO) method to enable the model not only output predictions but also analyze the uncertainty of those predictions. We then proposed FinZero, a multimodal pre-trained model finetuned by UARPO to perform reasoning, prediction, and analytical understanding on the FVLDB financial time series. Extensive experiments validate that FinZero exhibits strong adaptability and scalability. After fine-tuning with UARPO, FinZero achieves an approximate 13.48\% improvement in prediction accuracy over GPT-4o in the high-confidence group, demonstrating the effectiveness of reinforcement learning fine-tuning in multimodal large model, including in financial time series forecasting tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating Compositional Reasoning in Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06037v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large pre-trained time series foundation models (TSFMs) have demonstrated promising zero-shot performance across a wide range of domains. However, a question remains: Do TSFMs succeed by memorizing patterns in training data, or do they possess the ability to reason about such patterns? While reasoning is a topic of great interest in the study of Large Language Models (LLMs), it is undefined and largely unexplored in the context of TSFMs. In this work, inspired by language modeling literature, we formally define compositional reasoning in forecasting and distinguish it from in-distribution generalization. We evaluate the reasoning and generalization capabilities of 16 popular deep learning forecasting models on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets. Additionally, through controlled studies, we systematically examine which design choices in 7 popular open-source TSFMs contribute to improved reasoning capabilities. Our study yields key insights into the impact of TSFM architecture design on compositional reasoning and generalization. We find that patch-based Transformers have the best reasoning performance, closely followed by residualized MLP-based architectures, which are 97\% less computationally complex in terms of FLOPs and 86\% smaller in terms of the number of trainable parameters. Interestingly, in some zero-shot out-of-distribution scenarios, these models can outperform moving average and exponential smoothing statistical baselines trained on in-distribution data. Only a few design choices, such as the tokenization method, had a significant (negative) impact on Transformer model performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adding structure to generalized additive models, with applications in ecology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07915v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalized additive models (GAMs) connecting a set of scalar covariates that map 1-1 to a response are commonly employed in ecology and beyond. However, covariates are often inherently non-scalar, taking multiple values for each observation of the response. They can sometimes have a temporal structure, e.g., a time series of temperatures, or a spatial structure, e.g., multiple soil pH measurements made at nearby locations. While aggregating or selectively summarizing such covariates to yield a scalar covariate allows the use of standard GAM fitting procedures, exactly how to do so can be problematic and information is necessarily lost. Naively including all $p$ components of a vector-valued covariate as $p$ separate covariates, say, without recognizing the structure, can lead to problems of multicollinearity, data sets that are excessively wide given the sample size, and difficulty extracting the primary signal provided by the covariate. Here we introduce three useful extensions to GAMs that efficiently and effectively handle vector-valued covariates without requiring one to choose aggregations or selective summarizations. These extensions are varying-coefficient, scalar-on-function and distributed lag models. While these models have existed for some time they remain relatively underused in ecology. This article aims to show when these models can be useful and how to fit them with the popular R package \mgcv{}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Suppl...</summary><p>Supplementary material will be posted online once data access agreements are in place</p></details> |
| **[Assessing Bias in the Variable Bandpass Periodic Block Bootstrap Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08647v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Variable Bandpass Periodic Block Bootstrap(VBPBB) is an innovative method for time series with periodically correlated(PC) components. This method applies bandpass filters to extract specific PC components from datasets, effectively eliminating unwanted interference such as noise. It then bootstraps the PC components, maintaining their correlation structure while resampling and enabling a clearer analysis of the estimation of the statistical properties of periodic patterns in time series data. While its efficiency has been demonstrated in environmental and epidemiological research, the theoretical properties of VBPBB, particularly regarding its bias of the estimated sampling distributions, remain unexamined. This study investigates issues regarding biases in VBPBB, including overall mean bias and pointwise mean bias, across a range of time series models of varying complexity, all of which exhibit periodic components. Using the R programming language, we simulate various PC time series and apply VBPBB to assess its bias under different conditions. Our findings provide key insights into the validity of VBPBB for periodic time series analysis and offer practical recommendations for its implementation, as well as directions for future theoretical advancements.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 8 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

We develop novel autocovariance-based estimation and inference methods for this model. The methodology is broadly applicable to economic and statistical functional time series with nonstationary dynamics. To illustrate our methodology and its usefulness, we apply it to the evaluation of the global economic impact of climate change, an issue of intrinsic importance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual Analysis of Time-Dependent Observables in Cell Signaling Simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08589v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability of a cell to communicate with its environment is essential for key cellular functions like replication, metabolism, or cell fate decisions. The involved molecular mechanisms are highly dynamic and difficult to capture experimentally. Simulation studies offer a valuable means for exploring and predicting how cell signaling processes unfold. We present a design study on the visual analysis of such studies to support 1) modelers in calibrating model parameters such that the simulated signal responses over time reflect reference behavior from cell biology research and 2) cell biologists in exploring the influence of receptor trafficking on the efficiency of signal transmission within the cell. We embed time series plots into parallel coordinates to enable a simultaneous analysis of model parameters and temporal outputs. A usage scenario illustrates how our approach assists with typical tasks such as assessing the plausibility of temporal outputs or their sensitivity across model configurations.</p></details> |  |
| **[GTS_Forecaster: a novel deep learning based geodetic time series forecasting toolbox with python](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10560v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geodetic time series -- such as Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) positions, satellite altimetry-derived sea surface height (SSH), and tide gauge (TG) records -- is essential for monitoring surface deformation and sea level change. Accurate forecasts of these variables can enhance early warning systems and support hazard mitigation for earthquakes, landslides, coastal storm surge, and long-term sea level. However, the nonlinear, non-stationary, and incomplete nature of such variables presents significant challenges for classic models, which often fail to capture long-term dependencies and complex spatiotemporal dynamics. We introduce GTS Forecaster, an open-source Python package for geodetic time series forecasting. It integrates advanced deep learning models -- including kernel attention networks (KAN), graph neural network-based gated recurrent units (GNNGRU), and time-aware graph neural networks (TimeGNN) -- to effectively model nonlinear spatial-temporal patterns. The package also provides robust preprocessing tools, including outlier detection and a reinforcement learning-based gap-filling algorithm, the Kalman-TransFusion Interpolation Framework (KTIF). GTS Forecaster currently supports forecasting, visualization, and evaluation of GNSS, SSH, and TG datasets, and is adaptable to general time series applications. By combining cutting-edge models with an accessible interface, it facilitates the application of deep learning in geodetic forecasting tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Comparative Analysis of Global and Local Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting for Contiguous Spatial Demand Regions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08214v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study evaluates three probabilistic forecasting strategies using LightGBM: global pooling, cluster-level pooling, and station-level modeling across a range of scenarios, from fully homogeneous simulated data to highly heterogeneous real-world Divvy bike-share demand observed during 2023 to 2024. Clustering was performed using the K-means algorithm applied to principal component analysis transformed covariates, which included time series features, counts of nearby transportation infrastructure, and local demographic characteristics. Forecasting performance was assessed using prediction interval coverage probability (PICP), normalized interval width (PINAW), and the mean squared error (MSE) of the median forecast. The results show that global LightGBM models incorporating station identifiers consistently outperform both cluster-level and station-level models across most scenarios. These global models effectively leverage the full cross-sectional dataset while enabling local adjustments through the station identifier, resulting in superior prediction interval coverage, sharper intervals, and lower forecast errors. In contrast, cluster-based models often suffer from residual within group heterogeneity, leading to degraded accuracy. Station-level models capture fine-grained local dynamics in heterogeneous settings. These findings underscore that global LightGBM models with embedded station identifiers provide a robust, scalable, and computationally efficient framework for transportation demand forecasting. By balancing global structure with local specificity, this approach offers a practical and effective solution for real-world mobility applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 5 tables, 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[Task-based Loss Functions in Computer Vision: A Comprehensive Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04242v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Loss functions are at the heart of deep learning, shaping how models learn and perform across diverse tasks. They are used to quantify the difference between predicted outputs and ground truth labels, guiding the optimization process to minimize errors. Selecting the right loss function is critical, as it directly impacts model convergence, generalization, and overall performance across various applications, from computer vision to time series forecasting. This paper presents a comprehensive review of loss functions, covering fundamental metrics like Mean Squared Error and Cross-Entropy to advanced functions such as Adversarial and Diffusion losses. We explore their mathematical foundations, impact on model training, and strategic selection for various applications, including computer vision (Discriminative and generative), tabular data prediction, and time series forecasting. For each of these categories, we discuss the most used loss functions in the recent advancements of deep learning techniques. Also, this review explore the historical evolution, computational efficiency, and ongoing challenges in loss function design, underlining the need for more adaptive and robust solutions. Emphasis is placed on complex scenarios involving multi-modal data, class imbalances, and real-world constraints. Finally, we identify key future directions, advocating for loss functions that enhance interpretability, scalability, and generalization, leading to more effective and resilient deep learning models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Customizing the Inductive Biases of Softmax Attention using Structured Matrices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07963v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The core component of attention is the scoring function, which transforms the inputs into low-dimensional queries and keys and takes the dot product of each pair. While the low-dimensional projection improves efficiency, it causes information loss for certain tasks that have intrinsically high-dimensional inputs. Additionally, attention uses the same scoring function for all input pairs, without imposing a distance-dependent compute bias for neighboring tokens in the sequence. In this work, we address these shortcomings by proposing new scoring functions based on computationally efficient structured matrices with high ranks, including Block Tensor-Train (BTT) and Multi-Level Low Rank (MLR) matrices. On in-context regression tasks with high-dimensional inputs, our proposed scoring functions outperform standard attention for any fixed compute budget. On language modeling, a task that exhibits locality patterns, our MLR-based attention method achieves improved scaling laws compared to both standard attention and variants of sliding window attention. Additionally, we show that both BTT and MLR fall under a broader family of efficient structured matrices capable of encoding either full-rank or distance-dependent compute biases, thereby addressing significant shortcomings of standard attention. Finally, we show that MLR attention has promising results for long-range time-series forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025.

| **[Clustering methods for Categorical Time Series and Sequences : A scoping review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07885v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objective: To provide an overview of clustering methods for categorical time series (CTS), a data structure commonly found in epidemiology, sociology, biology, and marketing, and to support method selection in regards to data characteristics. Methods: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, from inception up to November 2024 to identify articles that propose and evaluate clustering techniques for CTS. Methods were classified according to three major families -- distance-based, feature-based, and model-based -- and assessed on their ability to handle data challenges such as variable sequence length, multivariate data, continuous time, missing data, time-invariant covariates, and large data volumes. Results: Out of 14607 studies, we included 124 articles describing 129 methods, spanning domains such as artificial intelligence, social sciences, and epidemiology. Distance-based methods, particularly those using Optimal Matching, were most prevalent, with 56 methods. We identified 28 model-based methods, which demonstrated superior flexibility for handling complex data structures such as multivariate data, continuous time and time-invariant covariates. We also recorded 45 feature-based approaches, which were on average more scalable but less flexible. A searchable Web application was developed to facilitate method selection based on dataset characteristics ( https://cts-clustering-scoping-review-7sxqj3sameqvmwkvnzfynz.streamlit.app/ ) Discussion: While distance-based methods dominate, model-based approaches offer the richest modeling potential but are less scalable. Feature-based methods favor performance over flexibility, with limited support for complex data structures. Conclusion: This review highlights methodological diversity and gaps in CTS clustering. The proposed typology aims to guide researchers in selecting appropriate methods for their specific use cases.</p></details> |  |

We proceed in two steps: first, we estimate a time trend for dementia using a multi-state Cox model. The multi-state model addresses problems of both interval censoring arising from infrequent measurement and also measurement error in dementia. Second, we feed the estimated mean and variance of the time trend into a Kalman filter to infer the population level dementia process. Using data from the English Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA), we find that dementia incidence is no longer declining in England. Furthermore, our forecast is that future incidence remains constant, although there is considerable uncertainty in this forecast. Our two-step estimation procedure has significant computational advantages by combining a multi-state model with a time series method. To account for the short sample that is available for dementia, we derive expressions for the Kalman filter's convergence speed, size, and power to detect changes and conclude our estimator performs well even in short samples.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Supervised Temporal Super-Resolution of Energy Data using Generative Adversarial Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10587v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To bridge the temporal granularity gap in energy network design and operation based on Energy System Models, resampling of time series is required. While conventional upsampling methods are computationally efficient, they often result in significant information loss or increased noise. Advanced models such as time series generation models, Super-Resolution models and imputation models show potential, but also face fundamental challenges. The goal of time series generative models is to learn the distribution of the original data to generate high-resolution series with similar statistical characteristics. This is not entirely consistent with the definition of upsampling. Time series Super-Resolution models or imputation models can degrade the accuracy of upsampling because the input low-resolution time series are sparse and may have insufficient context. Moreover, such models usually rely on supervised learning paradigms. This presents a fundamental application paradox: their training requires the high-resolution time series that is intrinsically absent in upsampling application scenarios. To address the mentioned upsampling issue, this paper introduces a new method utilizing Generative Adversarial Transformers (GATs), which can be trained without access to any ground-truth high-resolution data. Compared with conventional interpolation methods, the introduced method can reduce the root mean square error (RMSE) of upsampling tasks by 9%, and the accuracy of a model predictive control (MPC) application scenario is improved by 13%.</p></details> |  |

Drawing on daily and monthly open-source intelligence (OSINT) data from WarSpotting, we aim to assess trends in attrition, evaluate model performance, and estimate future loss patterns through the end of 2025. Our findings show that deep learning models, particularly TCN and LSTM, produce stable and consistent forecasts, especially under conditions of high temporal granularity. By comparing different model architectures and input structures, this study highlights the importance of ensemble forecasting in conflict modeling, and the value of publicly available OSINT data in quantifying material degradation over time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Estimation of Cointegration Vectors in Time Series via Global Optimisation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02552v3)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Analysis has been given a great amount of study in which many useful tests were developed. The phenomenal work of Engle and Granger in 1987 and Johansen in 1988 has paved the way for the most commonly used cointegration tests so far. Even though cointegrating relationships focus on long-term behaviour and correlation of multiple nonstationary time series, oftentimes we encounter statistical data with limited sample sizes and other information. Thus other tests with empirical advantages may also be of considerable importance. In this paper, we provide an optimisation approach motivated by the Blind Source Separation, or also known as Independent Component Analysis, for cointegration between financial time series. Two methods for cointegration tests are introduced, namely decorrelation for the bivariate case and maximisation of nongaussianity for higher-dimensions. We highlight the empirical preponderances of independent components and also the computational simplicity, compared to common practices of cointegration such as the Johansen's Cointegration Test. The advantages of our methods, especially the better performances in limited sample size, enable a wider range of application and accessibility for researchers and practitioners to identify cointegrating relationships.</p></details> |  |
| **[IBN: An Interpretable Bidirectional-Modeling Network for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Variable Missing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07725v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) often faces challenges from missing variables, which hinder conventional spatial-temporal graph neural networks in modeling inter-variable correlations. While GinAR addresses variable missing using attention-based imputation and adaptive graph learning for the first time, it lacks interpretability and fails to capture more latent temporal patterns due to its simple recursive units (RUs). To overcome these limitations, we propose the Interpretable Bidirectional-modeling Network (IBN), integrating Uncertainty-Aware Interpolation (UAI) and Gaussian kernel-based Graph Convolution (GGCN). IBN estimates the uncertainty of reconstructed values using MC Dropout and applies an uncertainty-weighted strategy to mitigate high-risk reconstructions. GGCN explicitly models spatial correlations among variables, while a bidirectional RU enhances temporal dependency modeling. Extensive experiments show that IBN achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance under various missing-rate scenarios, providing a more reliable and interpretable framework for MTSF with missing variables. Code is available at: https://github.com/zhangth1211/NICLab-IBN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty-Driven Hierarchical Sampling for Unbalanced Continual Malware Detection with Time-Series Update-Based Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07532v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Android malware detection continues to face persistent challenges stemming from long-term concept drift and class imbalance, as evolving malicious behaviors and shifting usage patterns dynamically reshape feature distributions. Although continual learning (CL) mitigates drift, existing replay-based methods suffer from inherent bias. Specifically, their reliance on classifier uncertainty for sample selection disproportionately prioritizes the dominant benign class, causing overfitting and reduced generalization to evolving malware. To address these limitations, we propose a novel uncertainty-guided CL framework. First, we introduce a hierarchical balanced sampler that employs a dual-phase uncertainty strategy to dynamically balance benign and malicious samples while simultaneously selecting high-information, high-uncertainty instances within each class. This mechanism ensures class equilibrium across both replay and incremental data, thereby enhancing adaptability to emerging threats. Second, we augment the framework with a vector retrieval mechanism that exploits historical malware embeddings to identify evolved variants via similarity-based retrieval, thereby complementing classifier updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods under strict low-label conditions (50 labels per phase). It achieves a true positive rate (TPR) of 92.95\% and a mean accuracy (mACC) of 94.26\%, which validates its efficacy for sustainable Android malware detection.</p></details> | 10 pages,6 figures |

It is widely used in data monitoring in practice. In this work, we consider sequential change-point detection for compositional time series, time series in which the observations are proportions. For fitting compositional time series, we propose a generalized Beta AR(1) model, which can incorporate exogenous variables upon which the time series observations are dependent. We show the compositional time series are strictly stationary and geometrically ergodic and consider maximum likelihood estimation for model parameters. We show the partial MLEs are consistent and asymptotically normal and propose a parametric sequential change-point detection method for the compositional time series model. The change-point detection method is illustrated using a time series of Covid-19 positivity rates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Highly Efficient Direct Analytics on Semantic-aware Time Series Data Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13246v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic communication has emerged as a promising paradigm to tackle the challenges of massive growing data traffic and sustainable data communication. It shifts the focus from data fidelity to goal-oriented or task-oriented semantic transmission. While deep learning-based methods are commonly used for semantic encoding and decoding, they struggle with the sequential nature of time series data and high computation cost, particularly in resource-constrained IoT environments. Data compression plays a crucial role in reducing transmission and storage costs, yet traditional data compression methods fall short of the demands of goal-oriented communication systems. In this paper, we propose a novel method for direct analytics on time series data compressed by the SHRINK compression algorithm. Through experimentation using outlier detection as a case study, we show that our method outperforms baselines running on uncompressed data in multiple cases, with merely 1% difference in the worst case. Additionally, it achieves four times lower runtime on average and accesses approximately 10% of the data volume, which enables edge analytics with limited storage and computation power. These results demonstrate that our approach offers reliable, high-speed outlier detection analytics for diverse IoT applications while extracting semantics from time-series data, achieving high compression, and reducing data transmission.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an extended version of arXiv:2503.13246, with significant additional contributions</p></details> |
| **[Matrix-variate integer-valued autoregressive processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07347v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the fields of sociology and economics, the modeling of matrix-variate integervalued time series is urgent. However, no prior studies have addressed the modeling of such data. To address this topic, this paper proposes a novel matrix-variate integer-valued autoregressive model. The key techniques lie in defining two leftand right-matricial thinning operators. The probabilistic and statistical properties of the proposed model are investigated. Furthermore, two estimation methods are developed: projection estimation and iterative least squares estimation. The corresponding asymptotic properties of these estimators are established. Additionally, the order-determination problem is addressed. In the simulation studies, the estimation results are given and the theoretical properties are verified. Finally, it is shown that the matrix-variate integer-valued autoregressive model is superior to the continuous matrix-variate autoregressive and multivariate integer-valued autoregressive models for matrix-variate integer-valued time series data.</p></details> |  |
| **[A novel statistical workflow for nonstationary modelling of successive Fréchet extremes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07296v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate estimation of the frequency and magnitude of successive extreme events in energy demand is critical for strategic resource planning. Traditional approaches based on extreme value theory (EVT) are typically limited to modelling isolated extreme events and struggle to capture the dynamics of temporally clustered extremes, such as those driven by prolonged extreme weather events. These limitations are exacerbated by the scarcity of historical data and computational costs of longrun simulations leading to high uncertainty in return level estimates for successive extremes. Here, we introduce a novel statistical framework leveraging recent theoretical advances in successive extreme value modelling in dynamical systems. Under reasonable assumptions of the time series data (e.g. the data follow a fat-tailed Fr\'{e}chet distribution), our tool allows for significantly more robust estimates of returns and magnitudes of successive extreme events compared to standard likelihood methods. We illustrate our statistical workflow on scenarios of forecasted gas supply levels from 2025 to 2050. Common measures of statistical accuracy are provided as benchmarks for comparison.</p></details> |  |
| **[Of Graphs and Tables: Zero-Shot Node Classification with Tabular Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07143v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph foundation models (GFMs) have recently emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving broad generalization across various graph data. However, existing GFMs are often trained on datasets that were shown to poorly represent real-world graphs, limiting their generalization performance. In contrast, tabular foundation models (TFMs) not only excel at classical tabular prediction tasks but have also shown strong applicability in other domains such as time series forecasting, natural language processing, and computer vision. Motivated by this, we take an alternative view to the standard perspective of GFMs and reformulate node classification as a tabular problem. Each node can be represented as a row with feature, structure, and label information as columns, enabling TFMs to directly perform zero-shot node classification via in-context learning. In this work, we introduce TabGFM, a graph foundation model framework that first converts a graph into a table via feature and structural encoders, applies multiple TFMs to diversely subsampled tables, and then aggregates their outputs through ensemble selection. Through experiments on 28 real-world datasets, TabGFM achieves consistent improvements over task-specific GNNs and state-of-the-art GFMs, highlighting the potential of tabular reformulation for scalable and generalizable graph learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Normalization for CUSUM-based Change Detection in Locally Stationary Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07112v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A novel self-normalization procedure for CUSUM-based change detection in the mean of a locally stationary time series is introduced. Classical self-normalization relies on the factorization of a constant long-run variance and a stochastic factor. In this case, the CUSUM statistic can be divided by another statistic proportional to the long-run variance, so that the latter cancels. Thereby, a tedious estimation of the long-run variance can be avoided. Under local stationarity, the partial sum process converges to $\int_0^t \sigma(x) d B_x$ and no such factorization is possible. To overcome this obstacle, a self-normalized test statistic is constructed from a carefully designed bivariate partial-sum process. Weak convergence of the process is proven, and it is shown that the resulting self-normalized test attains asymptotic level $\alpha$ under the null hypothesis of no change, while being consistent against a broad class of alternatives. Extensive simulations demonstrate better finite-sample properties compared to existing methods. Applications to real data illustrate the method's practical effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Keywo...</summary><p>Keywords: Change point analysis, gradual changes, local stationarity, self-normalization, CUSUM test Info: 42 pages, 4 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |
| **[Nested Optimal Transport Distances](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06702v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating realistic financial time series is essential for stress testing, scenario generation, and decision-making under uncertainty. Despite advances in deep generative models, there is no consensus metric for their evaluation. We focus on generative AI for financial time series in decision-making applications and employ the nested optimal transport distance, a time-causal variant of optimal transport distance, which is robust to tasks such as hedging, optimal stopping, and reinforcement learning. Moreover, we propose a statistically consistent, naturally parallelizable algorithm for its computation, achieving substantial speedups over existing approaches.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Neural ARFIMA model for forecasting BRIC exchange rates with long memory under oil shocks and policy uncertainties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06697v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate forecasting of exchange rates remains a persistent challenge, particularly for emerging economies such as Brazil, Russia, India, and China (BRIC). These series exhibit long memory, nonlinearity, and non-stationarity properties that conventional time series models struggle to capture. Additionally, there exist several key drivers of exchange rate dynamics, including global economic policy uncertainty, US equity market volatility, US monetary policy uncertainty, oil price growth rates, and country-specific short-term interest rate differentials. These empirical complexities underscore the need for a flexible modeling framework that can jointly accommodate long memory, nonlinearity, and the influence of external drivers. To address these challenges, we propose a Neural AutoRegressive Fractionally Integrated Moving Average (NARFIMA) model that combines the long-memory representation of ARFIMA with the nonlinear learning capacity of neural networks, while flexibly incorporating exogenous causal variables. We establish theoretical properties of the model, including asymptotic stationarity of the NARFIMA process using Markov chains and nonlinear time series techniques. We quantify forecast uncertainty using conformal prediction intervals within the NARFIMA framework. Empirical results across six forecast horizons show that NARFIMA consistently outperforms various state-of-the-art statistical and machine learning models in forecasting BRIC exchange rates. These findings provide new insights for policymakers and market participants navigating volatile financial conditions. The \texttt{narfima} \textbf{R} package provides an implementation of our approach.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we present an AI system that creates expert-level scientific software whose goal is to maximize a quality metric. The system uses a Large Language Model (LLM) and Tree Search (TS) to systematically improve the quality metric and intelligently navigate the large space of possible solutions. The system achieves expert-level results when it explores and integrates complex research ideas from external sources. The effectiveness of tree search is demonstrated across a wide range of benchmarks. In bioinformatics, it discovered 40 novel methods for single-cell data analysis that outperformed the top human-developed methods on a public leaderboard. In epidemiology, it generated 14 models that outperformed the CDC ensemble and all other individual models for forecasting COVID-19 hospitalizations. Our method also produced state-of-the-art software for geospatial analysis, neural activity prediction in zebrafish, time series forecasting and numerical solution of integrals. By devising and implementing novel solutions to diverse tasks, the system represents a significant step towards accelerating scientific progress.</p></details> | 71 pages, 26 figures |
| **[CAPMix: Robust Time Series Anomaly Detection Based on Abnormal Assumptions with Dual-Space Mixup](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06419v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a vital yet challenging task, particularly in scenarios where labeled anomalies are scarce and temporal dependencies are complex. Recent anomaly assumption (AA) approaches alleviate the lack of anomalies by injecting synthetic samples and training discriminative models. Despite promising results, these methods often suffer from two fundamental limitations: patchy generation, where scattered anomaly knowledge leads to overly simplistic or incoherent anomaly injection, and Anomaly Shift, where synthetic anomalies either resemble normal data too closely or diverge unrealistically from real anomalies, thereby distorting classification boundaries. In this paper, we propose CAPMix, a controllable anomaly augmentation framework that addresses both issues. First, we design a CutAddPaste mechanism to inject diverse and complex anomalies in a targeted manner, avoiding patchy generation. Second, we introduce a label revision strategy to adaptively refine anomaly labels, reducing the risk of anomaly shift. Finally, we employ dual-space mixup within a temporal convolutional network to enforce smoother and more robust decision boundaries. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets, including AIOps, UCR, SWaT, WADI, and ESA, demonstrate that CAPMix achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, with enhanced robustness against contaminated training data.

| **[Noise-Robust Phase Connectivity Estimation via Bayesian Circular Functional Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06418v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The phase locking value (PLV) is a widely used measure to detect phase connectivity. Main drawbacks of the standard PLV are it can be sensitive to noisy observations and does not provide uncertainty measures under finite samples. To overcome the difficulty, we propose a model-based PLV through nonparametric statistical modeling. Specifically, since the discrete time series of phase can be regarded as a functional observation taking values on circle, we employ a Bayesian model for circular-variate functional data, which gives denoising and inference on the resulting PLV values. The proposed model is defined through "wrapping" functional Gaussian models on real line, for which we develop an efficient posterior computation algorithm using Gibbs sampler. The usefulness of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulation experiments based on real EEG data.</p></details> | 17 pages |
| **[MedualTime: A Dual-Adapter Language Model for Medical Time Series-Text Multimodal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06620v4)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent rapid advancements in language models (LMs) have garnered attention in medical time series-text multimodal learning. However, existing contrastive learning-based and prompt-based LM approaches tend to be biased, often assigning a primary role to time series modality while treating text modality as secondary. We classify these approaches under a temporal-primary paradigm, which may overlook the unique and critical task-relevant information embedded in text modality like clinical reports, thus failing to fully leverage mutual benefits and complementarity of different modalities. To fill this gap, we propose a novel textual-temporal multimodal learning paradigm that enables either modality to serve as the primary while being enhanced by the other, thereby effectively capturing modality-specific information and fostering cross-modal interaction. In specific, we design MedualTime, a language model composed of dual adapters to implement temporal-primary and textual-primary modeling simultaneously. Within each adapter, lightweight adaptation tokens are injected into the top layers of LM to encourage high-level modality fusion. The shared LM pipeline by dual adapters not only achieves adapter alignment but also enables efficient fine-tuning, reducing computational resources. Empirically, MedualTime demonstrates superior performance on medical data, achieving notable improvements of 8% accuracy and 12% F1 in supervised settings. Furthermore, MedualTime's transferability is validated by few-shot label transfer experiments from coarse-grained to fine-grained medical data. https://github.com/start2020/MedualTime</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figure, 3 tables</p></details> |
