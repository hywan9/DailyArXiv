| **[Efficiently Generating Correlated Sample Paths from Multi-step Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02224v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many time series applications require access to multi-step forecast trajectories in the form of sample paths. Recently, time series foundation models have leveraged multi-step lookahead predictions to improve the quality and efficiency of multi-step forecasts. However, these models only predict independent marginal distributions for each time step, rather than a full joint predictive distribution. To generate forecast sample paths with realistic correlation structures, one typically resorts to autoregressive sampling, which can be extremely expensive. In this paper, we present a copula-based approach to efficiently generate accurate, correlated sample paths from existing multi-step time series foundation models in one forward pass. Our copula-based approach generates correlated sample paths orders of magnitude faster than autoregressive sampling, and it yields improved sample path quality by mitigating the snowballing error phenomenon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Transformers for Imputation: Statistical Efficiency and Uncertainty Quantification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02216v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imputation methods play a critical role in enhancing the quality of practical time-series data, which often suffer from pervasive missing values. Recently, diffusion-based generative imputation methods have demonstrated remarkable success compared to autoregressive and conventional statistical approaches. Despite their empirical success, the theoretical understanding of how well diffusion-based models capture complex spatial and temporal dependencies between the missing values and observed ones remains limited. Our work addresses this gap by investigating the statistical efficiency of conditional diffusion transformers for imputation and quantifying the uncertainty in missing values. Specifically, we derive statistical sample complexity bounds based on a novel approximation theory for conditional score functions using transformers, and, through this, construct tight confidence regions for missing values. Our findings also reveal that the efficiency and accuracy of imputation are significantly influenced by the missing patterns. Furthermore, we validate these theoretical insights through simulation and propose a mixed-masking training strategy to enhance the imputation performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>49 pa...</summary><p>49 pages, 4 figures.

| **[VarCoNet: A variability-aware self-supervised framework for functional connectome extraction from resting-state fMRI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02120v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accounting for inter-individual variability in brain function is key to precision medicine. Here, by considering functional inter-individual variability as meaningful data rather than noise, we introduce VarCoNet, an enhanced self-supervised framework for robust functional connectome (FC) extraction from resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data. VarCoNet employs self-supervised contrastive learning to exploit inherent functional inter-individual variability, serving as a brain function encoder that generates FC embeddings readily applicable to downstream tasks even in the absence of labeled data. Contrastive learning is facilitated by a novel augmentation strategy based on segmenting rs-fMRI signals. At its core, VarCoNet integrates a 1D-CNN-Transformer encoder for advanced time-series processing, enhanced with a robust Bayesian hyperparameter optimization. Our VarCoNet framework is evaluated on two downstream tasks: (i) subject fingerprinting, using rs-fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project, and (ii) autism spectrum disorder (ASD) classification, using rs-fMRI data from the ABIDE I and ABIDE II datasets. Using different brain parcellations, our extensive testing against state-of-the-art methods, including 13 deep learning methods, demonstrates VarCoNet's superiority, robustness, interpretability, and generalizability. Overall, VarCoNet provides a versatile and robust framework for FC analysis in rs-fMRI.</p></details> | <details><summary>My pr...</summary><p>My preview .pdf was not loading.

| **[KAIROS: Unified Training for Universal Non-Autoregressive Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02084v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the World Wide Web, reliable time series forecasts provide the forward-looking signals that drive resource planning, cache placement, and anomaly response, enabling platforms to operate efficiently as user behavior and content distributions evolve. Compared with other domains, time series forecasting for Web applications requires much faster responsiveness to support real-time decision making. We present KAIROS, a non-autoregressive time series forecasting framework that directly models segment-level multi-peak distributions. Unlike autoregressive approaches, KAIROS avoids error accumulation and achieves just-in-time inference, while improving over existing non-autoregressive models that collapse to over-smoothed predictions. Trained on the large-scale corpus, KAIROS demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization on six widely used benchmarks, delivering forecasting performance comparable to state-of-the-art foundation models with similar scale, at a fraction of their inference cost. Beyond empirical results, KAIROS highlights the importance of non-autoregressive design as a scalable paradigm for foundation models in time series.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-o1: Time-Series Forecasting Needs Transformed Label Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17847v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training time-series forecast models presents unique challenges in designing effective learning objectives. Existing methods predominantly utilize the temporal mean squared error, which faces two critical challenges: (1) label autocorrelation, which leads to bias from the label sequence likelihood; (2) excessive amount of tasks, which increases with the forecast horizon and complicates optimization. To address these challenges, we propose Time-o1, a transformation-augmented learning objective tailored for time-series forecasting. The central idea is to transform the label sequence into decorrelated components with discriminated significance. Models are then trained to align the most significant components, thereby effectively mitigating label autocorrelation and reducing task amount. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Time-o1 achieves state-of-the-art performance and is compatible with various forecast models. Code is available at https://github.com/Master-PLC/Time-o1.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as poster in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Moon: A Modality Conversion-based Efficient Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01970v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series (MTS) anomaly detection identifies abnormal patterns where each timestamp contains multiple variables. Existing MTS anomaly detection methods fall into three categories: reconstruction-based, prediction-based, and classifier-based methods. However, these methods face two key challenges: (1) Unsupervised learning methods, such as reconstruction-based and prediction-based methods, rely on error thresholds, which can lead to inaccuracies; (2) Semi-supervised methods mainly model normal data and often underuse anomaly labels, limiting detection of subtle anomalies;(3) Supervised learning methods, such as classifier-based approaches, often fail to capture local relationships, incur high computational costs, and are constrained by the scarcity of labeled data. To address these limitations, we propose Moon, a supervised modality conversion-based multivariate time series anomaly detection framework. Moon enhances the efficiency and accuracy of anomaly detection while providing detailed anomaly analysis reports. First, Moon introduces a novel multivariate Markov Transition Field (MV-MTF) technique to convert numeric time series data into image representations, capturing relationships across variables and timestamps. Since numeric data retains unique patterns that cannot be fully captured by image conversion alone, Moon employs a Multimodal-CNN to integrate numeric and image data through a feature fusion model with parameter sharing, enhancing training efficiency. Finally, a SHAP-based anomaly explainer identifies key variables contributing to anomalies, improving interpretability. Extensive experiments on six real-world MTS datasets demonstrate that Moon outperforms six state-of-the-art methods by up to 93% in efficiency, 4% in accuracy and, 10.8% in interpretation performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Novel Approach for Estimating Largest Lyapunov Exponents in One-Dimensional Chaotic Time Series Using Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04868v3)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and quantifying chaos from data remains challenging. We present a data-driven method for estimating the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) from one-dimensional chaotic time series using machine learning. A predictor is trained to produce out-of-sample, multi-horizon forecasts; the LLE is then inferred from the exponential growth of the geometrically averaged forecast error (GMAE) across the horizon, which serves as a proxy for trajectory divergence. We validate the approach on four canonical 1D maps-logistic, sine, cubic, and Chebyshev-achieving R2pos > 0.99 against reference LLE curves with series as short as M = 450. Among baselines, KNN yields the closest fits (KNN-R comparable; RF larger deviations). By design the estimator targets positive exponents: in periodic/stable regimes it returns values indistinguishable from zero. Noise robustness is assessed by adding zero-mean white measurement noise and summarizing performance versus the average SNR over parameter sweeps: accuracy saturates for SNRm > 30 dB and collapses below 27 dB, a conservative sensor-level benchmark. The method is simple, computationally efficient, and model-agnostic, requiring only stationarity and the presence of a dominant positive exponent. It offers a practical route to LLE estimation in experimental settings where only scalar time-series measurements are available, with extensions to higher-dimensional and irregularly sampled data left for future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures, 2 Tables, 14 Equations</p></details> |
| **[Wasserstein multivariate auto-regressive models for modeling distributional time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05442v6)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper is focused on the statistical analysis of data consisting of a collection of multiple series of probability measures that are indexed by distinct time instants and supported over a bounded interval of the real line. By modeling these time-dependent probability measures as random objects in the Wasserstein space, we propose a new auto-regressive model for the statistical analysis of multivariate distributional time series. Using the theory of iterated random function systems, results on the second order stationarity of the solution of such a model are provided. We also propose a consistent estimator for the auto-regressive coefficients of this model. Due to the simplex constraints that we impose on the model coefficients, the proposed estimator that is learned under these constraints, naturally has a sparse structure. The sparsity allows the application of the proposed model in learning a graph of temporal dependency from multivariate distributional time series. We explore the numerical performances of our estimation procedure using simulated data. To shed some light on the benefits of our approach for real data analysis, we also apply this methodology to two data sets, respectively made of observations from age distribution in different countries and those from the bike sharing network in Paris.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Foundational are Foundation Models for Time Series Forecasting?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00742v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation Models are designed to serve as versatile embedding machines, with strong zero shot capabilities and superior generalization performance when fine-tuned on diverse downstream tasks. While this is largely true for language and vision foundation models, we argue that the inherent diversity of time series data makes them less suited for building effective foundation models. We demonstrate this using forecasting as our downstream task. We show that the zero-shot capabilities of a time series foundation model are significantly influenced and tied to the specific domains it has been pretrained on. Furthermore, when applied to unseen real-world time series data, fine-tuned foundation models do not consistently yield substantially better results, relative to their increased parameter count and memory footprint, than smaller, dedicated models tailored to the specific forecasting task at hand.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Recent Advances in Time Series Foundation Models (BERT2S)</p></details> |
| **[Are Time Series Foundation Models Susceptible to Catastrophic Forgetting?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00809v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have shown promising zero-shot generalization across diverse forecasting tasks. However, their robustness to continual adaptation remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate the extent to which TSFMs suffer from catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuned sequentially on multiple datasets. Using synthetic datasets designed with varying degrees of periodic structure, we measure the trade-off between adaptation to new data and retention of prior knowledge. Our experiments reveal that, while fine-tuning improves performance on new tasks, it often causes significant degradation on previously learned ones, illustrating a fundamental stability-plasticity dilemma.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Capacity Expansion Modelling for Renewable Energy Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06750v3)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Future greenhouse gas neutral energy systems will be dominated by renewable energy technologies whose energy output and utilisation is subject to uncertain weather conditions. This work proposes an algorithm for capacity expansion planning if only uncertain data is available for a year's operative parameters. When faced with multiple possible operating years, the quality of a solution derived on a single operating year's data is evaluated for all years, and the optimisation problem is iteratively modified whenever supply gaps are detected. These modifications lead to solutions with sufficient back-up capacity to overcome periods of cold dark lulls, and sufficient total annual energy supply across all years. A computational study on an energy system model of Germany for 40 different operating years shows that the iterative algorithm finds solutions that guarantee security of supply for all considered years increasing the total annual cost by 1.6-2.9% compared to a lower bound. Results also underline the importance of assessing the feasibility of energy system models using atypical time-series, combining dark lull and cold period effects.</p></details> |  |
| **[IndexNet: Timestamp and Variable-Aware Modeling for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23813v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) plays a vital role in a wide range of real-world applications, such as weather prediction and traffic flow forecasting. Although recent advances have significantly improved the modeling of temporal dynamics and inter-variable dependencies, most existing methods overlook index-related descriptive information, such as timestamps and variable indices, which carry rich contextual semantics. To unlock the potential of such information and take advantage of the lightweight and powerful periodic capture ability of MLP-based architectures, we propose IndexNet, an MLP-based framework augmented with an Index Embedding (IE) module. The IE module consists of two key components: Timestamp Embedding (TE) and Channel Embedding (CE). Specifically, TE transforms timestamps into embedding vectors and injects them into the input sequence, thereby improving the model's ability to capture long-term complex periodic patterns. In parallel, CE assigns each variable a unique and trainable identity embedding based on its index, allowing the model to explicitly distinguish between heterogeneous variables and avoid homogenized predictions when input sequences seem close. Extensive experiments on 12 diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that IndexNet achieves comparable performance across mainstream baselines, validating the effectiveness of our temporally and variably aware design. Moreover, plug-and-play experiments and visualization analyses further reveal that IndexNet exhibits strong generality and interpretability, two aspects that remain underexplored in current MTSF research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Beyond Experience: Generalizing to Unseen State Space with Reservoir Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05292v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning techniques offer an effective approach to modeling dynamical systems solely from observed data. However, without explicit structural priors -- built-in assumptions about the underlying dynamics -- these techniques typically struggle to generalize to aspects of the dynamics that are poorly represented in the training data. Here, we demonstrate that reservoir computing -- a simple, efficient, and versatile machine learning framework often used for data-driven modeling of dynamical systems -- can generalize to unexplored regions of state space without explicit structural priors. First, we describe a multiple-trajectory training scheme for reservoir computers that supports training across a collection of disjoint time series, enabling effective use of available training data. Then, applying this training scheme to multistable dynamical systems, we show that RCs trained on trajectories from a single basin of attraction can achieve out-of-domain generalization by capturing system behavior in entirely unobserved basins.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 12 figures.

| **[Forecasting intraday particle number size distribution: A functional time series approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01692v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Particulate matter data now include various particle sizes, which often manifest as a collection of curves observed sequentially over time. When considering 51 distinct particle sizes, these curves form a high-dimensional functional time series observed over equally spaced and densely sampled grids. While high dimensionality poses statistical challenges due to the curse of dimensionality, it also offers a rich source of information that enables detailed analysis of temporal variation across short time intervals for all particle sizes. To model this complexity, we propose a multilevel functional time series framework incorporating a functional factor model to facilitate one-day-ahead forecasting. To quantify forecast uncertainty, we develop a calibration approach and a split conformal prediction approach to construct prediction intervals. Both approaches are designed to minimise the absolute difference between empirical and nominal coverage probabilities using a validation dataset. Furthermore, to improve forecast accuracy as new intraday data become available, we implement dynamic updating techniques for point and interval forecasts. The proposed methods are validated through an empirical application to hourly measurements of particulate matter in 51 size categories in London.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 11 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Learning Time-Series Representations by Hierarchical Uniformity-Tolerance Latent Balancing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01658v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose TimeHUT, a novel method for learning time-series representations by hierarchical uniformity-tolerance balancing of contrastive representations. Our method uses two distinct losses to learn strong representations with the aim of striking an effective balance between uniformity and tolerance in the embedding space. First, TimeHUT uses a hierarchical setup to learn both instance-wise and temporal information from input time-series. Next, we integrate a temperature scheduler within the vanilla contrastive loss to balance the uniformity and tolerance characteristics of the embeddings. Additionally, a hierarchical angular margin loss enforces instance-wise and temporal contrast losses, creating geometric margins between positive and negative pairs of temporal sequences. This approach improves the coherence of positive pairs and their separation from the negatives, enhancing the capture of temporal dependencies within a time-series sample. We evaluate our approach on a wide range of tasks, namely 128 UCR and 30 UAE datasets for univariate and multivariate classification, as well as Yahoo and KPI datasets for anomaly detection. The results demonstrate that TimeHUT outperforms prior methods by considerable margins on classification, while obtaining competitive results for anomaly detection. Finally, detailed sensitivity and ablation studies are performed to evaluate different components and hyperparameters of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Transactions on Machine Learning Research</p></details> |
| **[FTSCommDetector: Discovering Behavioral Communities through Temporal Synchronization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00014v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Why do trillion-dollar tech giants AAPL and MSFT diverge into different response patterns during market disruptions despite identical sector classifications? This paradox reveals a fundamental limitation: traditional community detection methods fail to capture synchronization-desynchronization patterns where entities move independently yet align during critical moments. To this end, we introduce FTSCommDetector, implementing our Temporal Coherence Architecture (TCA) to discover similar and dissimilar communities in continuous multivariate time series. Unlike existing methods that process each timestamp independently, causing unstable community assignments and missing evolving relationships, our approach maintains coherence through dual-scale encoding and static topology with dynamic attention. Furthermore, we establish information-theoretic foundations demonstrating how scale separation maximizes complementary information and introduce Normalized Temporal Profiles (NTP) for scale-invariant evaluation. As a result, FTSCommDetector achieves consistent improvements across four diverse financial markets (SP100, SP500, SP1000, Nikkei 225), with gains ranging from 3.5% to 11.1% over the strongest baselines. The method demonstrates remarkable robustness with only 2% performance variation across window sizes from 60 to 120 days, making dataset-specific tuning unnecessary, providing practical insights for portfolio construction and risk management.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Can Time Series Analysis Benefit From Multiple Modalities? A Survey and Outlook](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11835v4)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis (TSA) is a longstanding research topic in the data mining community and has wide real-world significance. Compared to "richer" modalities such as language and vision, which have recently experienced explosive development and are densely connected, the time-series modality remains relatively underexplored and isolated. We notice that many recent TSA works have formed a new research field, i.e., Multiple Modalities for TSA (MM4TSA). In general, these MM4TSA works follow a common motivation: how TSA can benefit from multiple modalities. This survey is the first to offer a comprehensive review and a detailed outlook for this emerging field. Specifically, we systematically discuss three benefits: (1) reusing foundation models of other modalities for efficient TSA, (2) multimodal extension for enhanced TSA, and (3) cross-modality interaction for advanced TSA. We further group the works by the introduced modality type, including text, images, audio, tables, and others, within each perspective. Finally, we identify the gaps with future opportunities, including the reused modalities selections, heterogeneous modality combinations, and unseen tasks generalizations, corresponding to the three benefits. We release an up-to-date GitHub repository that includes key papers and resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>Githu...</summary><p>Github Repo: https://github.com/AdityaLab/MM4TSA Updated to include papers accepted by IJCAI25, KDD25, ICML25, NeurIPS25 4 figures or tables, 19 pages, 251 references</p></details> |
| **[AI Foundation Model for Time Series with Innovations Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01560v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces an Artificial Intelligence (AI) foundation model for time series in engineering applications, where causal operations are required for real-time monitoring and control. Since engineering time series are governed by physical, rather than linguistic, laws, large-language-model-based AI foundation models may be ineffective or inefficient. Building on the classical innovations representation theory of Wiener, Kallianpur, and Rosenblatt, we propose Time Series GPT (TS-GPT) -- an innovations-representation-based Generative Pre-trained Transformer for engineering monitoring and control. As an example of foundation model adaptation, we consider Probabilistic Generative Forecasting, which produces future time series samples from conditional probability distributions given past realizations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TS-GPT in forecasting real-time locational marginal prices using historical data from U.S. independent system operators.</p></details> |  |
| **[MS-DFTVNet:A Long-Term Time Series Prediction Method Based on Multi-Scale Deformable Convolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17253v4)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research on long-term time series prediction has primarily relied on Transformer and MLP models, while the potential of convolutional networks in this domain remains underexplored. To address this, we propose a novel multi-scale time series reshape module that effectively captures cross-period patch interactions and variable dependencies. Building on this, we develop MS-DFTVNet, the multi-scale 3D deformable convolutional framework tailored for long-term forecasting. Moreover, to handle the inherently uneven distribution of temporal features, we introduce a context-aware dynamic deformable convolution mechanism, which further enhances the model's ability to capture complex temporal patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MS-DFTVNet not only significantly outperforms strong baselines but also achieves an average improvement of about 7.5% across six public datasets, setting new state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeSeriesScientist: A General-Purpose AI Agent for Time Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01538v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is central to decision-making in domains as diverse as energy, finance, climate, and public health. In practice, forecasters face thousands of short, noisy series that vary in frequency, quality, and horizon, where the dominant cost lies not in model fitting, but in the labor-intensive preprocessing, validation, and ensembling required to obtain reliable predictions. Prevailing statistical and deep learning models are tailored to specific datasets or domains and generalize poorly. A general, domain-agnostic framework that minimizes human intervention is urgently in demand. In this paper, we introduce TimeSeriesScientist (TSci), the first LLM-driven agentic framework for general time series forecasting. The framework comprises four specialized agents: Curator performs LLM-guided diagnostics augmented by external tools that reason over data statistics to choose targeted preprocessing; Planner narrows the hypothesis space of model choice by leveraging multi-modal diagnostics and self-planning over the input; Forecaster performs model fitting and validation and, based on the results, adaptively selects the best model configuration as well as ensemble strategy to make final predictions; and Reporter synthesizes the whole process into a comprehensive, transparent report. With transparent natural-language rationales and comprehensive reports, TSci transforms the forecasting workflow into a white-box system that is both interpretable and extensible across tasks. Empirical results on eight established benchmarks demonstrate that TSci consistently outperforms both statistical and LLM-based baselines, reducing forecast error by an average of 10.4% and 38.2%, respectively. Moreover, TSci produces a clear and rigorous report that makes the forecasting workflow more transparent and interpretable.</p></details> |  |
| **[CarbonX: An Open-Source Tool for Computational Decarbonization Using Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01521v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational decarbonization aims to reduce carbon emissions in computing and societal systems such as data centers, transportation, and built environments. This requires accurate, fine-grained carbon intensity forecasts, yet existing tools have several key limitations: (i) they require grid-specific electricity mix data, restricting use where such information is unavailable; (ii) they depend on separate grid-specific models that make it challenging to provide global coverage; and (iii) they provide forecasts without uncertainty estimates, limiting reliability for downstream carbon-aware applications. In this paper, we present CarbonX, an open-source tool that leverages Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) for a range of decarbonization tasks. CarbonX utilizes the versatility of TSFMs to provide strong performance across multiple tasks, such as carbon intensity forecasting and imputation, and across diverse grids. Using only historical carbon intensity data and a single general model, our tool achieves a zero-shot forecasting Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 15.82% across 214 grids worldwide. Across 13 benchmark grids, CarbonX performance is comparable with the current state-of-the-art, with an average MAPE of 9.59% and tail forecasting MAPE of 16.54%, while also providing prediction intervals with 95% coverage. CarbonX can provide forecasts for up to 21 days with minimal accuracy degradation. Further, when fully fine-tuned, CarbonX outperforms the statistical baselines by 1.2--3.9X on the imputation task. Overall, these results demonstrate that CarbonX can be used easily on any grid with limited data and still deliver strong performance, making it a practical tool for global-scale decarbonization.</p></details> |  |

We address this challenge with an end-to-end approach for learning optimal drug dosing and control policies for dual vasopressor administration in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with septic shock. For realistic drug dosing, we apply action space design that accommodates discrete, continuous, and directional dosing strategies in a system that combines offline conservative Q-learning with a novel recurrent modeling in a replay buffer to capture temporal dependencies in ICU time-series data. Our comparative analysis of norepinephrine dosing strategies across different action space formulations reveals that the designed action spaces improve interpretability and facilitate clinical adoption while preserving efficacy. Empirical results1 on eICU and MIMIC demonstrate that action space design profoundly influences learned behavioral policies. The proposed methods achieve improved patient outcomes of over 15% in survival improvement probability, while aligning with established clinical protocols.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Reconstructing Brain Causal Dynamics for Subject and Task Fingerprints using fMRI Time-series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06392v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: Recently, there has been a revived interest in system neuroscience causation models, driven by their unique capability to unravel complex relationships in multi-scale brain networks. In this paper, we present a novel method that leverages causal dynamics to achieve effective fMRI-based subject and task fingerprinting. Methods: By applying an implicit-explicit discretization scheme, we develop a two-timescale linear state-space model. Through data-driven identification of its parameters, the model captures causal signatures, including directed interactions among brain regions from a spatial perspective, and disentangled fast and slow dynamic modes of brain activity from a temporal perspective. These causal signatures are then integrated with: (i) a modal decomposition and projection method for model-based subject identification, and (ii) a Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for learning-based task classification. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of the brain reachability landscape as a novel visualization tool, which quantitatively characterizes the maximum possible activation levels of brain regions under various fMRI tasks. Results: We evaluate the proposed approach using the Human Connectome Project dataset and demonstrate its advantage over non-causality-based methods. The obtained causal signatures are visualized and demonstrate clear biological relevance with established understandings of brain function. Conclusion: We verified the feasibility and effectiveness of utilizing brain causal signatures for subject and task fingerprinting. Additionally, our work paves the way for further studies on causal fingerprints with potential applications in both healthy controls and neurodegenerative diseases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Data-Driven Control for Nonlinear Systems Using their Digital Twins and Quadratic Funnels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01406v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper examines a robust data-driven approach for the safe deployment of systems with nonlinear dynamics using their imperfect digital twins. Our contribution involves proposing a method that fuses the digital twin's nominal trajectory with online, data-driven uncertainty quantification to synthesize robust tracking controllers. Specifically, we derive data-driven bounds to capture the deviations of the actual system from its prescribed nominal trajectory informed via its digital twin. Subsequently, the dataset is used in the synthesis of quadratic funnels -- robust positive invariant tubes around the nominal trajectory -- via linear matrix inequalities built on the time-series data. The resulting controller guarantees constraint satisfaction while adapting to the true system behavior through a segmented learning strategy, where each segment's controller is synthesized using uncertainty information from the previous segment. This work establishes a systematic framework for obtaining safety certificates in learning-based control of nonlinear systems with imperfect models.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |

However, real-world data is limited despite its quantity, quality, and variety. The data shortage of various financial assets directly hinders the performance of machine learning models designed to trade and invest in these assets. Generative methods can mitigate this shortage. In this paper, we introduce a set of novel techniques for time series data generation (we name them Fiaingen) and assess their performance across three criteria: (a) overlap of real-world and synthetic data on a reduced dimensionality space, (b) performance on downstream machine learning tasks, and (c) runtime performance. Our experiments demonstrate that the methods achieve state-of-the-art performance across the three criteria listed above. Synthetic data generated with Fiaingen methods more closely mirrors the original time series data while keeping data generation time close to seconds - ensuring the scalability of the proposed approach. Furthermore, models trained on it achieve performance close to those trained with real-world data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Eliciting Chain-of-Thought Reasoning for Time Series Analysis using Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01116v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex numerical time series analysis often demands multi-step reasoning capabilities beyond current models' reach. Tasks like medical diagnosis and weather forecasting require sequential reasoning processes -- including counterfactual analysis, logical deduction, knowledge application, and multi-modal contextual integration -- that existing time series models cannot explicitly perform. While recent research has shown large language models (LLMs) can achieve sophisticated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning through reinforcement learning (RL), these advances have primarily focused on mathematical and coding domains, with LLMs still demonstrating poor performance on time series tasks. We introduce Chain Of thought for Understanding Numerical Time Series (COUNTS), the first framework that trains LLMs to perform CoT reasoning across diverse time series tasks using RL with verifiable rewards. Our approach employs a Residual Vector-Quantized VAE to create high-fidelity discrete tokens that seamlessly integrate into a pre-trained LLM's vocabulary. COUNTS undergoes a two-stage training process: first, supervised fine-tuning on time series analysis tasks to master our novel representations, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization training on verifiable problems using prompting strategies that encourage explicit reasoning steps before producing final answers. Our experiments demonstrate that this RL-driven approach with intermediate CoT reasoning significantly enhances LLM performance across various time series analysis tasks, opening new possibilities for complex temporal data reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Augmenting LLMs for General Time Series Understanding and Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01111v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data is fundamental to decision-making in many crucial domains including healthcare, finance, and environmental science. However, analyzing this data often requires incorporating unstructured contextual information, answering domain-specific questions, and generating natural language explanations -- capabilities that traditional time series models lack due to their inability to process text. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at contextual reasoning and knowledge integration, they struggle with numerical time series due to inefficient text-based representations and limited exposure to temporal data during pretraining. We address this gap by augmenting an LLM with specialized time series perception through a patch-based encoder-decoder architecture. We train this Time Series-augmented LLM (TsLLM) on a large corpus of over 2 million interleaved time series and text examples spanning diverse analysis tasks: forecasting with contextual information, time series question-answering, pattern explanation, classification with natural language outputs, and report generation. This training enables TsLLM to leverage both its language understanding and newly acquired temporal reasoning capabilities. While not designed to surpass specialized models on traditional benchmarks, TsLLM demonstrates strong performance on tasks requiring the integration of time series analysis with natural language -- capabilities that existing approaches cannot provide. Our work establishes a new paradigm for time series analysis that bridges numerical computation and natural language understanding, democratizing access to sophisticated temporal reasoning through natural language interaction.</p></details> |  |

Here we propose a novel method for this task, based on the framework of variational autoencoders for dynamical systems. The method estimates from the data both the system state trajectories and noise time series. This approach allows to perform multi-step system evolution and supports a teacher forcing strategy, alleviating limitations of autoencoder-based approaches for stochastic systems. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach on six test problems, covering simulated and experimental data. We further show the effects of the teacher forcing interval on the nature of the internal dynamics, and compare it to the deterministic models with equivalent architecture.</p></details> |  |
| **[Estimating Visceral Adiposity from Wrist-Worn Accelerometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09167v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is a key marker of both metabolic health and habitual physical activity (PA). Excess VAT is highly correlated with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance. The mechanistic basis for this pathophysiology relates to overloading the liver with fatty acids. VAT is also a highly labile fat depot, with increased turnover stimulated by catecholamines during exercise. VAT can be measured with sophisticated imaging technologies, but can also be inferred directly from PA. We tested this relationship using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 2011-2014, for individuals aged 20-60 years with 7 days of accelerometry data (n=2,456 men; 2,427 women) [1]. Two approaches were used for estimating VAT from activity. The first used engineered features based on movements during gait and sleep, and then ridge regression to map summary statistics of these features into a VAT estimate. The second approach used deep neural networks trained on 24 hours of continuous accelerometry. A foundation model first mapped each 10s frame into a high-dimensional feature vector. A transformer model then mapped each day's feature vector time series into a VAT estimate, which were averaged over multiple days. For both approaches, the most accurate estimates were obtained with the addition of covariate information about subject demographics and body measurements. The best performance was obtained by combining the two approaches, resulting in VAT estimates with correlations of r=0.86. These findings demonstrate a strong relationship between PA and VAT and, by extension, between PA and metabolic health risks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics</p></details> |
| **[Hybrid Predictive Modeling of Malaria Incidence in the Amhara Region, Ethiopia: Integrating Multi-Output Regression and Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01302v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Malaria remains a major public health concern in Ethiopia, particularly in the Amhara Region, where seasonal and unpredictable transmission patterns make prevention and control challenging. Accurately forecasting malaria outbreaks is essential for effective resource allocation and timely interventions. This study proposes a hybrid predictive modeling framework that combines time-series forecasting, multi-output regression, and conventional regression-based prediction to forecast the incidence of malaria. Environmental variables, past malaria case data, and demographic information from Amhara Region health centers were used to train and validate the models. The multi-output regression approach enables the simultaneous prediction of multiple outcomes, including Plasmodium species-specific cases, temporal trends, and spatial variations, whereas the hybrid framework captures both seasonal patterns and correlations among predictors. The proposed model exhibits higher prediction accuracy than single-method approaches, exposing hidden patterns and providing valuable information to public health authorities. This study provides a valid and repeatable malaria incidence prediction framework that can support evidence-based decision-making, targeted interventions, and resource optimization in endemic areas.</p></details> |  |
| **[Random Feature Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01012v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) as Machine Learning (ML) models have recently received a lot of attention as a potentially more energy-efficient alternative to conventional Artificial Neural Networks. The non-differentiability and sparsity of the spiking mechanism can make these models very difficult to train with algorithms based on propagating gradients through the spiking non-linearity. We address this problem by adapting the paradigm of Random Feature Methods (RFMs) from Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to Spike Response Model (SRM) SNNs. This approach allows training of SNNs without approximation of the spike function gradient. Concretely, we propose a novel data-driven, fast, high-performance, and interpretable algorithm for end-to-end training of SNNs inspired by the SWIM algorithm for RFM-ANNs, which we coin S-SWIM. We provide a thorough theoretical discussion and supplementary numerical experiments showing that S-SWIM can reach high accuracies on time series forecasting as a standalone strategy and serve as an effective initialisation strategy before gradient-based training. Additional ablation studies show that our proposed method performs better than random sampling of network weights.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages incl. references & appendix, 3 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Differential Privacy of Network Parameters from a System Identification Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20460v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the problem of protecting network information from privacy system identification (SI) attacks when sharing cyber-physical system simulations. We model analyst observations of networked states as time-series outputs of a graph filter driven by differentially private (DP) nodal excitations, with the analyst aiming to infer the underlying graph shift operator (GSO). Unlike traditional SI, which estimates system parameters, we study the inverse problem: what assumptions prevent adversaries from identifying the GSO while preserving utility for legitimate analysis. We show that applying DP mechanisms to inputs provides formal privacy guarantees for the GSO, linking the $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP bound to the spectral properties of the graph filter and noise covariance. More precisely, for DP Gaussian signals, the spectral characteristics of both the filter and noise covariance determine the privacy bound, with smooth filters and low-condition-number covariance yielding greater privacy.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces the Fuzzy Transformer (Fuzzformer), a novel recurrent neural network architecture combined with multi-head self-attention and fuzzy inference systems to analyze multivariate stock market data and conduct long-term time series forecasting. The method leverages LSTM networks and temporal attention to condense multivariate data into interpretable features suitable for fuzzy inference systems. The resulting architecture offers comparable forecasting performance to conventional models such as ARIMA and LSTM while providing meaningful information flow within the network. The method was examined on the real world stock market index S\&P500. Initial results show potential for interpretable forecasting and identify current performance tradeoffs, suggesting practical application in understanding and forecasting stock market behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in: ERK 2025 -- 34th International Electrotechnical and Computer Science Conference, Portoro\v{z}, Slovenia, Sept. 25--26, 2025.

| **[Simultaneous estimation of the effective reproduction number and the time series of daily infections: Application to Covid-19](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21027v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The time varying effective reproduction number is an important parameter for communication and policy decisions during an epidemic. In this paper, we present new statistical methods for estimating the reproduction number based on the popular model of \citet{cori2013new} which defines the effective reproduction number based on self-exciting dynamics of new infections. Such a model is conceptually simple and less susceptible to misspecifications than more complicated multi-compartment models. However, statistical inference is challenging, and the previous literature has either relied on proxy data and/or a two-step approach in which the number of infections are first estimated. In contrast, we present a coherent Bayesian method that approximates the joint posterior of daily new infections and reproduction numbers using a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Comparing our method to the state-of-the-art three-step estimation procedure of \citet{huisman2022estimation}, both using daily confirmed cases from Switzerland in the Covid-19 epidemic and simulated data, we find that our method is more accurate in terms of point estimates and uncertainty quantification, especially near the beginning and end of an observation period.</p></details> |  |
| **[Functional Regression with Nonstationarity and Error Contamination: Application to the Economic Impact of Climate Change](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08591v3)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies a regression model with functional dependent and explanatory variables, both of which exhibit nonstationary dynamics. The model assumes that the nonstationary stochastic trends of the dependent variable are explained by those of the explanatory variables, and hence that there exists a stable long-run relationship between the two variables despite their nonstationary behavior. We also assume that the functional observations may be error-contaminated. We develop novel autocovariance-based estimation and inference methods for this model. The methodology is broadly applicable to economic and statistical functional time series with nonstationary dynamics. To illustrate our methodology and its usefulness, we apply it to evaluating the global economic impact of climate change, an issue of intrinsic importance.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Visual Diagnostics Framework for District Heating Data: Enhancing Data Quality for AI-Driven Heat Consumption Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00872v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality data is a prerequisite for training reliable Artificial Intelligence (AI) models in the energy domain. In district heating networks, sensor and metering data often suffer from noise, missing values, and temporal inconsistencies, which can significantly degrade model performance. This paper presents a systematic approach for evaluating and improving data quality using visual diagnostics, implemented through an interactive web-based dashboard. The dashboard employs Python-based visualization techniques, including time series plots, heatmaps, box plots, histograms, correlation matrices, and anomaly-sensitive KPIs such as skewness and anomaly detection based on the modified z-scores. These tools al-low human experts to inspect and interpret data anomalies, enabling a human-in-the-loop strategy for data quality assessment. The methodology is demonstrated on a real-world dataset from a Danish district heating provider, covering over four years of hourly data from nearly 7000 meters. The findings show how visual analytics can uncover systemic data issues and, in the future, guide data cleaning strategies that enhance the accuracy, stability, and generalizability of Long Short-Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Unit models for heat demand forecasting. The study contributes to a scalable, generalizable framework for visual data inspection and underlines the critical role of data quality in AI-driven energy management systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Energ...</summary><p>Energy Informatics.Academy Conference 2025 (EI.A 2025), 3-6 December 2025, Universiti Tenaga Nasional (UNITEN), Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia</p></details> |
| **[Automated flood detection from Sentinel-1 GRD time series using Bayesian analysis for change point problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19526v3)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)-based flood detection methods face critical limitations that hinder operational deployment. Supervised learning approaches require extensive labeled training data, exhibit poor geographical transferability, and may fail to adapt to new regions without additional training examples. Existing approaches do not fully exploit the rich temporal information available in SAR time series, instead relying on simple change detection between pre- and post-flood images or supplementary datasets that often introduce error propagation. These limitations prevent effective automated flood monitoring in data-scarce regions where disaster response is most needed. To address these limitations, we develop a novel training-free approach by adapting Bayesian analysis for change point problems, specifically for automated flood detection from Sentinel-1 Ground Range Detected time series data. Our method statistically models the temporal behavior of SAR backscatter intensity over a one-year baseline period, then computes the posterior probability of change points at flood observation dates. This approach eliminates supervised learning dependencies by using Bayesian inference to identify when backscatter deviations exceed expected normal variations, leveraging inherent statistical properties of time series data. Validation across three diverse geographical contexts using the UrbanSARFloods benchmark dataset demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional thresholding and deep learning approaches, achieving F1 scores up to 0.76. This enables immediate deployment to any region with SAR coverage, providing critical advantages for disaster response.</p></details> | 17 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Federated Dynamic Modeling and Learning for Spatiotemporal Data Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04528v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an advanced Federated Learning (FL) framework for forecasting complex spatiotemporal data, improving upon recent state-of-the-art models. In the proposed approach, the original Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) module within previous Dynamic Spatial--Temporal Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (DSTGCRN) modeling is first replaced with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, enabling the resulting model to more effectively capture long-term dependencies inherent to time series data. The resulting architecture significantly improves the model's capacity to handle complex temporal patterns in diverse forecasting applications. Furthermore, the proposed FL framework integrates a novel Client-Side Validation (CSV) mechanism, introducing a critical validation step at the client level before incorporating aggregated parameters from the central server into local models, ensuring only the most effective updates are retained and improving both the robustness and accuracy of the forecasting model across clients. The efficiency of our approach is demonstrated through extensive experiments on real-world applications, including public datasets for multimodal transport demand forecasting and private datasets for Origin-Destination (OD) matrix forecasting in urban areas. The results demonstrate substantial improvements over conventional methods, highlighting the framework's ability to capture complex spatiotemporal dependencies while preserving data privacy. This work not only provides a scalable and privacy-preserving solution for real-time, region-specific forecasting and management but also underscores the potential of leveraging distributed data sources in a FL context. We provide our algorithms as open-source on GitHub</p></details> |  |
| **[TShape: Rescuing Machine Learning Models from Complex Shapelet Anomalies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00680v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is critical for maintaining the reliability of modern IT infrastructures, where complex anomalies frequently arise in highly dynamic environments. In this paper, we present TShape, a novel framework designed to address the challenges in industrial time series anomaly detection. Existing methods often struggle to detect shapelet anomalies that manifest as complex shape deviations, which appear obvious to human experts but prove challenging for machine learning algorithms. TShape introduces a patch-wise dual attention mechanism with multi-scale convolution to model intricate sub-sequence variations by balancing local, fine-grained shape features with global contextual dependencies. Our extensive evaluation on five diverse benchmarks demonstrates that TShape outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, achieving an average 10\% F1 score improvement in anomaly detection. Additionally, ablation studies and attention visualizations confirm the essential contributions of each component, highlighting the robustness and adaptability of TShape to complex shapelet shapes in time series data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Memory Determines Learning Direction: A Theory of Gradient-Based Optimization in State Space Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00563v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State space models (SSMs) have gained attention by showing potential to outperform Transformers. However, previous studies have not sufficiently addressed the mechanisms underlying their high performance owing to a lack of theoretical explanation of SSMs' learning dynamics. In this study, we provide such an explanation and propose an improved training strategy. The memory capacity of SSMs can be evaluated by examining how input time series are stored in their current state. Such an examination reveals a tradeoff between memory accuracy and length, as well as the theoretical equivalence between the structured state space sequence model (S4) and a simplified S4 with diagonal recurrent weights. This theoretical foundation allows us to elucidate the learning dynamics, proving the importance of initial parameters. Our analytical results suggest that successful learning requires the initial memory structure to be the longest possible even if memory accuracy may deteriorate or the gradient lose the teacher information. Experiments on tasks requiring long memory confirmed that extending memory is difficult, emphasizing the importance of initialization. Furthermore, we found that fixing recurrent weights can be more advantageous than adapting them because it achieves comparable or even higher performance with faster convergence. Our results provide a new theoretical foundation for SSMs and potentially offer a novel optimization strategy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian power spectral density estimation for LISA noise based on P-splines with a parametric boost](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00533v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flexible and efficient noise characterization is crucial for the precise estimation of gravitational wave parameters. We introduce a fast and accurate Bayesian method for estimating the power spectral density (PSD) of long, stationary time series tailored specifically for LISA data analysis. Our approach models the PSD as a geometric mean of a parametric and a nonparametric component, combining the computational efficiency of parametric models with the flexibility to capture deviations from theoretical expectations. The nonparametric component is expressed by a mixture of penalized B-splines. Adaptive, data-driven knot placement performed once during initialization eliminates computationally expensive reversible-jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo, while hierarchical roughness penalty priors prevent overfitting. This design yields stable, flexible PSD estimates with runtimes of minutes instead of hours. Validation on simulated autoregressive AR(4) data demonstrates estimator consistency. It shows that well-matched parametric components reduce the integrated absolute error compared to an uninformative baseline, requiring fewer spline knots to achieve comparable accuracy. Applied to a year of simulated LISA $X$-channel noise, our method achieves relative integrated absolute errors of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$ with computation times less than three minutes, which makes it suitable for iterative analysis pipelines and multi-year mission datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Pattern-Specific Experts for Time Series Forecasting Under Patch-level Distribution Shift](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09836v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting, which aims to predict future values based on historical data, has garnered significant attention due to its broad range of applications. However, real-world time series often exhibit complex non-uniform distribution with varying patterns across segments, such as season, operating condition, or semantic meaning, making accurate forecasting challenging. Existing approaches, which typically train a single model to capture all these diverse patterns, often struggle with the pattern drifts between patches and may lead to poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose TFPS, a novel architecture that leverages pattern-specific experts for more accurate and adaptable time series forecasting. TFPS employs a dual-domain encoder to capture both time-domain and frequency-domain features, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of temporal dynamics. It then uses subspace clustering to dynamically identify distinct patterns across data patches. Finally, pattern-specific experts model these unique patterns, delivering tailored predictions for each patch. By explicitly learning and adapting to evolving patterns, TFPS achieves significantly improved forecasting accuracy. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that TFPS outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in long-term forecasting, through its dynamic and pattern-aware learning approach. The data and codes are available: https://github.com/syrGitHub/TFPS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Black-Box Time-Series Domain Adaptation via Cross-Prompt Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00487v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The black-box domain adaptation (BBDA) topic is developed to address the privacy and security issues where only an application programming interface (API) of the source model is available for domain adaptations. Although the BBDA topic has attracted growing research attentions, existing works mostly target the vision applications and are not directly applicable to the time-series applications possessing unique spatio-temporal characteristics. In addition, none of existing approaches have explored the strength of foundation model for black box time-series domain adaptation (BBTSDA). This paper proposes a concept of Cross-Prompt Foundation Model (CPFM) for the BBTSDA problems. CPFM is constructed under a dual branch network structure where each branch is equipped with a unique prompt to capture different characteristics of data distributions. In the domain adaptation phase, the reconstruction learning phase in the prompt and input levels is developed. All of which are built upon a time-series foundation model to overcome the spatio-temporal dynamic. Our rigorous experiments substantiate the advantage of CPFM achieving improved results with noticeable margins from its competitors in three time-series datasets of different application domains.</p></details> |  |

However, progress has been hampered by an overemphasis on architectural complexity at the expense of fundamental forecasting principles. In this work, we return to first principles to redesign the LTSF paradigm. We begin by introducing a Multiple Neural Forecasting Theorem that provides a theoretical basis for our approach. We propose Boosted Direct Output (BDO), a novel forecasting strategy that synergistically combines the advantages of both Auto-Regressive (AR) and Direct Output (DO). In addition, we stabilize the learning process by smoothly tracking the model's parameters. Extensive experiments show that these principled improvements enable a simple MLP to achieve state-of-the-art performance, outperforming recent, complex models in nearly all cases, without any specific considerations in the area. Finally, we empirically verify our theorem, establishing a dynamic performance bound and identifying promising directions for future research.

| **[TimeEmb: A Lightweight Static-Dynamic Disentanglement Framework for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00461v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal non-stationarity, the phenomenon that time series distributions change over time, poses fundamental challenges to reliable time series forecasting. Intuitively, the complex time series can be decomposed into two factors, \ie time-invariant and time-varying components, which indicate static and dynamic patterns, respectively. Nonetheless, existing methods often conflate the time-varying and time-invariant components, and jointly learn the combined long-term patterns and short-term fluctuations, leading to suboptimal performance facing distribution shifts. To address this issue, we initiatively propose a lightweight static-dynamic decomposition framework, TimeEmb, for time series forecasting. TimeEmb innovatively separates time series into two complementary components: (1) time-invariant component, captured by a novel global embedding module that learns persistent representations across time series, and (2) time-varying component, processed by an efficient frequency-domain filtering mechanism inspired by full-spectrum analysis in signal processing. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that TimeEmb outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and requires fewer computational resources. We conduct comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses to verify the efficacy of static-dynamic disentanglement. This lightweight framework can also improve existing time-series forecasting methods with simple integration. To ease reproducibility, the code is available at https://github.com/showmeon/TimeEmb.</p></details> |  |

These models provide high-dimensional Hilbert spaces and intrinsic nonlinear dynamics, making them powerful substrates for temporal information processing. We systematically benchmark both reservoirs through linear and nonlinear memory tasks, demonstrating that they exhibit an unusual superior nonlinear over linear memory capacity. We further test their predictive performance on the Mackey-Glass time series, a widely used benchmark for chaotic dynamics and show comparable forecasting ability. We also investigate how memory and prediction accuracy vary with reservoir parameters, and show the role of higher-order bosonic observables and time multiplexing in enhancing expressivity, even in minimal spin-boson configurations. Our results establish JC- and DJC-based reservoirs as versatile platforms for time-series processing and as elementary units that overcome the setting of equivalent qubit pairs and offer pathways towards tunable, high-performance quantum machine learning architectures.</p></details> | 15 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Stab-QRAM: An All-Clifford Quantum Random Access Memory for Special Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26494v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum random access memories (QRAMs) are pivotal for data-intensive quantum algorithms, but existing general-purpose and domain-specific architectures are hampered by a critical bottleneck: a heavy reliance on non-Clifford gates (e.g., T-gates), which are prohibitively expensive to implement fault-tolerantly. To address this challenge, we introduce the Stabilizer-QRAM (Stab-QRAM), a domain-specific architecture tailored for data with an affine Boolean structure ($f(\mathbf{x}) = A\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}$ over $\mathbb{F}_2$), a class of functions vital for optimization, time-series analysis, and quantum linear systems algorithms. We demonstrate that the gate interactions required to implement the matrix $A$ form a bipartite graph. By applying K\"{o}nig's edge-coloring theorem to this graph, we prove that Stab-QRAM achieves an optimal logical circuit depth of $O(\log N)$ for $N$ data items, matching its $O(\log N)$ space complexity. Critically, the Stab-QRAM is constructed exclusively from Clifford gates (CNOT and X), resulting in a zero $T$-count. This design completely circumvents the non-Clifford bottleneck, eliminating the need for costly magic state distillation and making it exceptionally suited for early fault-tolerant quantum computing platforms. We highlight Stab-QRAM's utility as a resource-efficient oracle for applications in discrete dynamical systems, and as a core component in Quantum Linear Systems Algorithms, providing a practical pathway for executing data-intensive tasks on emerging quantum hardware.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

Existing benchmarks often have narrow domain coverage or overlook important real-world settings, such as tasks with covariates. Additionally, their aggregation procedures often lack statistical rigor, making it unclear whether observed performance differences reflect true improvements or random variation. Many benchmarks also fail to provide infrastructure for consistent evaluation or are too rigid to integrate into existing pipelines. To address these gaps, we propose fev-bench, a benchmark comprising 100 forecasting tasks across seven domains, including 46 tasks with covariates. Supporting the benchmark, we introduce fev, a lightweight Python library for benchmarking forecasting models that emphasizes reproducibility and seamless integration with existing workflows. Usingfev, fev-bench employs principled aggregation methods with bootstrapped confidence intervals to report model performance along two complementary dimensions: win rates and skill scores. We report results on fev-bench for various pretrained, statistical and baseline models, and identify promising directions for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Far Do Time Series Foundation Models Paint the Landscape of Real-World Benchmarks ?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26347v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent evaluations of time-series foundation models (TSFMs) have emphasized synthetic benchmarks, leaving real-world generalization less thoroughly examined. This work proposes a novel benchmarking approach that bridges synthetic and realistic data by extracting temporal signals from real-world video using optical flow and curating datasets reflecting everyday temporal dynamics. Building upon this pipeline, we introduce REAL-V-TSFM, a novel dataset designed to capture rich and diverse time series derived from real-world videos. Experimental results on three state-of-the-art of TSFMs under zero-shot forecasting shows that, despite strong performance on conventional benchmarks, these models predominantly exhibit performance degradation on the proposed dataset, indicating limited generalizability in these foundation models. These findings highlight the urgent need for data-centric benchmarking and diverse model structure to advance TSFMs toward genuine universality, while further validating the effectiveness of our video-based time series data extraction pipeline.</p></details> |  |

Anomaly detection (AD) can identify deviations from expected patterns in data, which can be used to trigger failsafe behaviors and recovery strategies. Prior work has applied data-driven AD to time series data in specific robotic tasks, but its transferability across control strategies and task types has not been shown. Leveraging time series data, such as force/torque signals, allows to directly capture robot-environment interactions, crucial for manipulation and online failure detection. Their broad availability, high sampling rates, and low dimensionality enable high temporal resolution and efficient processing. As robotic tasks can have widely signal characteristics and requirements, AD methods which can be applied in the same way to a wide range of tasks is needed, ideally with good data efficiency. We examine three industrial robotic tasks, each presenting several anomalies. Test scenarios in robotic cabling, screwing, and sanding are built, and multimodal time series data is gathered. Several autoencoder-based methods are compared, evaluating generalization across tasks and control methods (diffusion policy, position, and impedance control). This allows us to validate the integration of AD in complex tasks involving tighter tolerances and variation from both the robot and its environment. Additionally, we evaluate data efficiency, detection latency, and task characteristics which support robust detection. The results indicate reliable detection with AUROC exceeding 0.93 in failures in the cabling and screwing task, such as incorrect or misaligned parts and obstructed targets. In the polishing task, only severe failures were reliably detected, while more subtle failure types remained undetected.</p></details> |  |

Advances in these methods have led to ever-increasing data sizes and, consequently, interest and development of out-of-core processing and visualization techniques, although mostly as specialized solutions. Here we present Palace, an open-source, cross-platform, general-purpose library for interactive and accelerated out-of-core tensor processing and visualization. Through a high-performance asynchronous concurrent architecture and a simple compute-graph interface, Palace enables the interactive development of out-of-core pipelines on workstation hardware. We demonstrate on benchmarks that Palace outperforms or matches state-of-the-art systems for volume rendering and hierarchical random-walker segmentation and demonstrate applicability in use cases involving tensors from 2D images up to 4D time series datasets.</p></details> |  |

Yet, existing approaches rely on temporally-agnostic patch construction, where arbitrary starting positions and fixed lengths fracture temporal coherence by splitting natural transitions across boundaries. This naive segmentation often disrupts short-term dependencies and weakens representation learning. In response, we propose EntroPE (Entropy-Guided Dynamic Patch Encoder), a novel, temporally informed framework that dynamically detects transition points via conditional entropy and dynamically places patch boundaries. This preserves temporal structure while retaining the computational benefits of patching. EntroPE consists of two key modules, namely an Entropy-based Dynamic Patcher (EDP) that applies information-theoretic criteria to locate natural temporal shifts and determine patch boundaries, and an Adaptive Patch Encoder (APE) that employs pooling and cross-attention to capture intra-patch dependencies and produce fixed-size latent representations. These embeddings are then processed by a global transformer to model inter-patch dynamics. Experiments across long-term forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that EntroPE improves both accuracy and efficiency, establishing entropy-guided dynamic patching as a promising new paradigm for time series modeling. Code is available at: https://github.com/Sachithx/EntroPE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint. Under Review</p></details> |

Social media data provides a new perspective for depression detection, but existing methods face limitations such as insufficient accuracy, insufficient utilization of time series features, and high annotation costs. To this end, this study proposes the LMILAtt model, which innovatively integrates Long Short-Term Memory autoencoders and attention mechanisms: firstly, the temporal dynamic features of user tweets (such as depressive tendency evolution patterns) are extracted through unsupervised LSTM autoencoders. Secondly, the attention mechanism is used to dynamically weight key texts (such as early depression signals) and construct a multi-example learning architecture to improve the accuracy of user-level detection. Finally, the performance was verified on the WU3D dataset labeled by professional medicine. Experiments show that the model is significantly better than the baseline model in terms of accuracy, recall and F1 score. In addition, the weakly supervised learning strategy significantly reduces the cost of labeling and provides an efficient solution for large-scale social media depression screening.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revealing the temporal dynamics of antibiotic anomalies in the infant gut microbiome with neural jump ODEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00087v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting anomalies in irregularly sampled multi-variate time-series is challenging, especially in data-scarce settings. Here we introduce an anomaly detection framework for irregularly sampled time-series that leverages neural jump ordinary differential equations (NJODEs). The method infers conditional mean and variance trajectories in a fully path dependent way and computes anomaly scores. On synthetic data containing jump, drift, diffusion, and noise anomalies, the framework accurately identifies diverse deviations. Applied to infant gut microbiome trajectories, it delineates the magnitude and persistence of antibiotic-induced disruptions: revealing prolonged anomalies after second antibiotic courses, extended duration treatments, and exposures during the second year of life. We further demonstrate the predictive capabilities of the inferred anomaly scores in accurately predicting antibiotic events and outperforming diversity-based baselines. Our approach accommodates unevenly spaced longitudinal observations, adjusts for static and dynamic covariates, and provides a foundation for inferring microbial anomalies induced by perturbations, offering a translational opportunity to optimize intervention regimens by minimizing microbial disruptions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fuzzy Jump Models for Soft and Hard Clustering of Multivariate Time Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26029v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Statistical jump models have been recently introduced to detect persistent regimes by clustering temporal features and discouraging frequent regime changes. However, they are limited to hard clustering and thereby do not account for uncertainty in state assignments. This work presents an extension of the statistical jump model that incorporates uncertainty estimation in cluster membership. Leveraging the similarities between statistical jump models and the fuzzy c-means framework, our fuzzy jump model sequentially estimates time-varying state probabilities. Our approach offers high flexibility, as it supports both soft and hard clustering through the tuning of a fuzziness parameter, and it naturally accommodates multivariate time series data of mixed types. Through a simulation study, we evaluate the ability of the proposed model to accurately estimate the true latent-state distribution, demonstrating that it outperforms competing approaches under high cluster assignment uncertainty. We further demonstrate its utility on two empirical applications: first, by automatically identifying co-orbital regimes in the three-body problem, a novel application with important implications for understanding asteroid behavior and designing interplanetary mission trajectories; and second, on a financial dataset of five assets representing distinct market sectors (equities, bonds, foreign exchange, cryptocurrencies, and utilities), where the model accurately tracks both bull and bear market phases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Kairos: Towards Adaptive and Generalizable Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25826v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series foundation models (TSFMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for time series analysis, driven by large-scale pretraining on diverse data corpora. However, time series inherently exhibit heterogeneous information density over time, influenced by system states and signal complexity, presenting significant modeling challenges especially in a zero-shot scenario. Current TSFMs rely on non-adaptive processing pipelines that fail to capture this dynamic nature. For example, common tokenization strategies such as fixed-size patching enforce rigid observational granularity, limiting their ability to adapt to varying information densities. Similarly, conventional positional encodings impose a uniform temporal scale, making it difficult to model diverse periodicities and trends across series. To overcome these limitations, we propose Kairos, a flexible TSFM framework that integrates a dynamic patching tokenizer and an instance-adaptive positional embedding. Kairos adaptively selects tokenization granularity and tailors positional encodings to the unique characteristics of each time series instance. Trained on a large-scale Predictability-Stratified Time Series (PreSTS) corpus comprising over 300 billion time points and adopting a multi-patch prediction strategy in the inference stage, Kairos achieves superior performance with much fewer parameters on two common zero-shot benchmarks, GIFT-Eval and the Time-Series-Library benchmark, consistently outperforming established methods across diverse tasks.

| **[BEDTime: A Unified Benchmark for Automatically Describing Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05215v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works propose complex multi-modal models that handle both time series and language, ultimately claiming high performance on complex tasks like time series reasoning and cross-modal question-answering. However, they skip evaluations of simple and important foundational tasks, which complex models should reliably master. They also lack direct, head-to-head comparisons with other popular approaches. So we ask a simple question: Can recent models even produce generic visual descriptions of time series data? In response, we propose three new tasks, posing that successful multi-modal models should be able to recognize, differentiate, and generate language descriptions of time series. We then create BEDTime, the first benchmark dataset to assess models on each task, comprising four datasets reformatted for these tasks across multiple modalities. Using BEDTime, we evaluate 13 state-of-the-art models, and find that (1) surprisingly, dedicated time series foundation models severely underperform, despite being designed for similar tasks, (2) vision-language models are quite capable, (3) language-only methods perform worst, despite many lauding their potential, and (4) all approaches are clearly fragile to a range of realistic robustness tests, indicating avenues for future work.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can VLM Pseudo-Labels Train a Time-Series QA Model That Outperforms the VLM?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25696v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series question answering (TSQA) tasks face significant challenges due to the lack of labeled data. Alternatively, with recent advancements in large-scale models, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated the potential to analyze time-series signals in a zero-shot manner. In this paper, we propose a training approach that uses pseudo labels generated by a VLM. Although VLMs can produce incorrect labels, TSQA models can still be effectively trained based on the property that deep neural networks are inherently robust to such noisy labels. Our experimental results demonstrate that TSQA models are not only successfully trained with pseudo labels, but also surpass the performance of the VLM itself by leveraging a large amount of unlabeled data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conformal Prediction for Signal Temporal Logic Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25473v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signal Temporal Logic (STL) inference seeks to extract human-interpretable rules from time-series data, but existing methods lack formal confidence guarantees for the inferred rules. Conformal prediction (CP) is a technique that can provide statistical correctness guarantees, but is typically applied as a post-training wrapper without improving model learning. Instead, we introduce an end-to-end differentiable CP framework for STL inference that enhances both reliability and interpretability of the resulting formulas. We introduce a robustness-based nonconformity score, embed a smooth CP layer directly into training, and employ a new loss function that simultaneously optimizes inference accuracy and CP prediction sets with a single term. Following training, an exact CP procedure delivers statistical guarantees for the learned STL formulas. Experiments on benchmark time-series tasks show that our approach reduces uncertainty in predictions (i.e., it achieves high coverage while reducing prediction set size), and improves accuracy (i.e., the number of misclassifications when using a fixed threshold) over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Does Multimodality Lead to Better Time Series Forecasting?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21611v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, there has been growing interest in incorporating textual information into foundation models for time series forecasting. However, it remains unclear whether and under what conditions such multimodal integration consistently yields gains. We systematically investigate these questions across a diverse benchmark of 16 forecasting tasks spanning 7 domains, including health, environment, and economics. We evaluate two popular multimodal forecasting paradigms: aligning-based methods, which align time series and text representations; and prompting-based methods, which directly prompt large language models for forecasting. Our findings reveal that the benefits of multimodality are highly condition-dependent. While we confirm reported gains in some settings, these improvements are not universal across datasets or models. To move beyond empirical observations, we disentangle the effects of model architectural properties and data characteristics, drawing data-agnostic insights that generalize across domains. Our findings highlight that on the modeling side, incorporating text information is most helpful given (1) high-capacity text models, (2) comparatively weaker time series models, and (3) appropriate aligning strategies. On the data side, performance gains are more likely when (4) sufficient training data is available and (5) the text offers complementary predictive signal beyond what is already captured from the time series alone. Our study offers a rigorous, quantitative foundation for understanding when multimodality can be expected to aid forecasting tasks, and reveals that its benefits are neither universal nor always aligned with intuition.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Embeddings Go Temporal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25449v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning has seen great success recently in unsupervised representation learning, enabling breakthroughs in natural language and image processing. However, these methods often rely on autoregressive and masked modeling, which aim to reproduce masked information in the input, which can be vulnerable to the presence of noise or confounding variables. To address this problem, Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA) has been introduced with the aim to perform self-supervised learning in the latent space. To leverage these advancements in the domain of time series, we introduce Time Series JEPA (TS-JEPA), an architecture specifically adapted for time series representation learning. We validate TS-JEPA on both classification and forecasting, showing that it can match or surpass current state-of-the-art baselines on different standard datasets. Notably, our approach demonstrates a strong performance balance across diverse tasks, indicating its potential as a robust foundation for learning general representations. Thus, this work lays the groundwork for developing future time series foundation models based on Joint Embedding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Workshop on Time Series in the Age of Large Models - NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[The Limits of Inference in Complex Systems: When Stochastic Models Become Indistinguishable](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24977v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust inference methods are essential for parameter estimation and model selection in stochastic modeling approaches, which provide interpretable frameworks for describing time series of complex phenomena. However, applying such methods is often challenging, as they typically demand either high-frequency observations or access to the model's analytical solution, resources that are rarely available in practice. Here, we address these limitations by designing a novel Monte Carlo method based on full-path statistics and bridge processes, which optimize sampling efforts and performance even under coarse sampling. We systematically investigate how experimental design -- particularly sampling frequency and dataset size -- shapes inference accuracy, revealing optimal sampling regimes and the fundamental limits of model distinguishability. We validate our approach on four datasets -- optical tweezers, human microbiome, topic mentions in social media, and forest population dynamics -- where resolution-dependent limits to inference emerge, offering fresh insight into ongoing debates about the dominant sources of noise in these systems. Overall, this work shows how combining minimal stochastic models with path-inference tools and model selection can guide the experimental design of optimized strategies in data collection and clarify the boundaries of model-based understanding in complex systems.</p></details> |  |

Genetic algorithms (GAs) provide a stochastic way to identify the structural changes: a population of candidate models evolves via selection, crossover, and mutation operators until it converges on one changepoint model that balances the goodness-of-fit with parsimony. The R package changepointGA encodes each candidate model as an integer chromosome vector and supports both the basic single-population model GA and the island model GA. Parallel computing is implemented on multi-core hardware to further accelerate computation. Users may supply custom fitness functions or genetic operators, while a user-friendly wrapper streamlines routine analyses. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our package runs significantly faster than binary-encoded GA alternatives. Additionally, this package can simultaneously locate changepoints and estimate their effects, as well as other model parameters and any integer-valued hyperparameters. Applications to array-based comparative genomic hybridization data and a century-long temperature series further highlight the package's value in biological and climate research.</p></details> |  |

We introduce reddemcee, an Adaptive Parallel Tempering Ensemble Sampler, aiming to close this gap by simultaneously presenting next-generation automated temperature-ladder adaptation techniques and robust, low-bias evidence estimators. reddemcee couples an affine-invariant stretch move with five interchangeable ladder-adaptation objectives, Uniform Swap Acceptance Rate, Swap Mean Distance, Gaussian-Area Overlap, Small Gaussian Gap, and Equalised Thermodynamic Length, implemented through a common differential update rule. Three evidence estimators are provided: Curvature-aware Thermodynamic Integration (TI+), Geometric-Bridge Stepping Stones (SS+), and a novel Hybrid algorithm that blends both approaches (H+). Performance and accuracy are benchmarked on n-dimensional Gaussian Shells, Gaussian Egg-box, Rosenbrock Functions, and exoplanet radial-velocity time-series of HD 20794. Across Shells up to 15 dimensions, reddemcee presents roughly 7 times the effective sampling speed of the best dynamic nested sampling configuration. The TI+, SS+ and H+ estimators recover estimates under 3 percent error and supply realistic uncertainties with as few as six temperatures. In the HD 20794 case study, reddemcee reproduces literature model rankings and yields tighter yet consistent planetary parameters compared with dynesty, with evidence errors that track run-to-run dispersion. By unifying fast ladder adaptation with reliable evidence estimators, reddemcee delivers strong throughput and accurate evidence estimates, often matching, and occasionally surpassing, dynamic nested sampling, while preserving the rich posterior information which makes MCMC indispensable for modern Bayesian inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: R...</summary><p>v2: Revised after referee comments; resubmitted to A&A on 24 Sep 2025</p></details> |

This study introduces an innovative information-theoretic method to identify and analyze information-transfer nodes within RNNs, which we refer to as \textit{information relays}. By quantifying the mutual information between input and output vectors across nodes, our approach pinpoints critical pathways through which information flows during network operations. We apply this methodology to both synthetic and real-world time series classification tasks, employing various RNN architectures, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). Our results reveal distinct patterns of information relay across different architectures, offering insights into how information is processed and maintained over time. Additionally, we conduct node knockout experiments to assess the functional importance of identified nodes, significantly contributing to explainable artificial intelligence by elucidating how specific nodes influence overall network behavior. This study not only enhances our understanding of the complex mechanisms driving RNNs but also provides a valuable tool for designing more robust and interpretable neural networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Double Machine Learning Based Structure Identification from Temporal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06012v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning the causes of time-series data is a fundamental task in many applications, spanning from finance to earth sciences or bio-medical applications. Common approaches for this task are based on vector auto-regression, and they do not take into account unknown confounding between potential causes. However, in settings with many potential causes and noisy data, these approaches may be substantially biased. Furthermore, potential causes may be correlated in practical applications or even contain cycles. To address these challenges, we propose a new double machine learning based method for structure identification from temporal data (DR-SIT). We provide theoretical guarantees, showing that our method asymptotically recovers the true underlying causal structure. Our analysis extends to cases where the potential causes have cycles, and they may even be confounded. We further perform extensive experiments to showcase the superior performance of our method.

However, existing multimodal time series datasets mostly remain at the level of surface alignment and question answering, without reaching the depth of genuine reasoning. The absence of well-defined tasks that genuinely require time series reasoning, along with the scarcity of high-quality data, has limited progress in building practical time series reasoning models (TSRMs). To this end, we introduce Time Series Reasoning Suite (TSR-Suite), which formalizes four atomic tasks that span three fundamental capabilities for reasoning with time series: (1) perception, acquired through scenario understanding and causality discovery; (2) extrapolation, realized via event-aware forecasting; and (3) decision-making, developed through deliberation over perception and extrapolation. TSR-Suite is the first comprehensive time series reasoning suite that supports not only thorough evaluation but also the data pipeline and training of TSRMs. It contains more than 23K samples, of which 2.3K are carefully curated through a human-guided hierarchical annotation process. Building on this foundation, we introduce TimeOmni-1, the first unified reasoning model designed to address diverse real-world problems demanding time series reasoning. The model is trained in multiple stages, integrating a mixture of task scenarios, novel reward functions, and tailored optimizations. Experiments show that TimeOmni-1 delivers strong out-of-distribution generalization across all tasks and achieves a high rate of valid responses. It significantly improves causality discovery accuracy (64.0% vs. 35.9% with GPT-4.1) and raises the valid response rate by over 6% compared to GPT-4.1 on the event-aware forecasting task.</p></details> |  |

Currently, common time series forecasting methods are based on Transformers. However, existing approaches primarily model limited time series or fixed scales, making it more challenging to capture diverse features cross different ranges. Additionally, traditional methods like STL for complex seasonality-trend decomposition require pre-specified seasonal periods and typically handle only single, fixed seasonality. We propose the Hybrid Decomposition Dual-Stream Adaptive Transformer (DSAT-HD), which integrates three key innovations to address the limitations of existing methods: 1) A hybrid decomposition mechanism combining EMA and Fourier decomposition with RevIN normalization, dynamically balancing seasonal and trend components through noise Top-k gating; 2) A multi-scale adaptive pathway leveraging a sparse allocator to route features to four parallel Transformer layers, followed by feature merging via a sparse combiner, enhanced by hybrid attention combining local CNNs and global interactions; 3) A dual-stream residual learning framework where CNN and MLP branches separately process seasonal and trend components, coordinated by a balanced loss function minimizing expert collaboration variance. Extensive experiments on nine datasets demonstrate that DSAT-HD outperforms existing methods overall and achieves state-of-the-art performance on some datasets. Notably, it also exhibits stronger generalization capabilities across various transfer scenarios.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

Existing datasets suffer from issues ranging from pre-training data contamination in the age of LLMs to the causal and description leakage prevalent in early multimodal designs. To address this, we formalize the core principles of high-fidelity benchmarking, focusing on data sourcing integrity, strict causal soundness, and structural clarity. We introduce Fidel-TS, a new large-scale benchmark built from the ground up on these principles by sourcing data from live APIs. Our extensive experiments validate this approach by exposing the critical biases and design limitations of prior benchmarks. Furthermore, we conclusively demonstrate that the causal relevance of textual information is the key factor in unlocking genuine performance gains in multimodal forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic-Enhanced Time-Series Forecasting via Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07697v3)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting plays a significant role in finance, energy, meteorology, and IoT applications. Recent studies have leveraged the generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to adapt to time series forecasting, achieving promising performance. However, existing studies focus on token-level modal alignment, instead of bridging the intrinsic modality gap between linguistic knowledge structures and time series data patterns, greatly limiting the semantic representation. To address this issue, we propose a novel Semantic-Enhanced LLM (SE-LLM) that explores the inherent periodicity and anomalous characteristics of time series to embed into the semantic space to enhance the token embedding. This process enhances the interpretability of tokens for LLMs, thereby activating the potential of LLMs for temporal sequence analysis. Moreover, existing Transformer-based LLMs excel at capturing long-range dependencies but are weak at modeling short-term anomalies in time-series data. Hence, we propose a plugin module embedded within self-attention that models long-term and short-term dependencies to effectively adapt LLMs to time-series analysis. Our approach freezes the LLM and reduces the sequence dimensionality of tokens, greatly reducing computational consumption. Experiments demonstrate the superiority performance of our SE-LLM against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.</p></details> | 14 pages,9 figures |

Switching diffusion models extend ordinary diffusions by allowing for jumps in instantaneous drift and volatility. The jumps are driven by a latent, continuous time Markov switching process. We address the problem through an MCMC and an MCEM algorithm that target the exact posterior of diffusion parameters and the latent regime process. The algorithms are exact in the sense that they target the correct posterior distribution of the continuous model, so that the errors are due to Monte Carlo only. We illustrate the method on numerical examples, including an empirical analysis of the method's scalability in the length of the time series, and find that it is comparable in computational cost with discrete approximations while avoiding their shortcomings.</p></details> |  |

These points define regimes for the time evolution of the system and are crucial for understanding transitions in financial, economic, social, environmental, and technological contexts. Building upon the Bayesian approach introduced in \cite{c:07}, we devise a new method for online change point detection in the mean of a univariate time series, which is well suited for real-time applications and is able to handle the general temporal patterns displayed by data in many empirical contexts. We first describe time series as an autoregressive process of an arbitrary order. Second, the variance and correlation of the data are allowed to vary within each regime driven by a scoring rule that updates the value of the parameters for a better fit of the observations. Finally, a change point is detected in a probabilistic framework via the posterior distribution of the current regime length. By modeling temporal dependencies and time-varying parameters, the proposed approach enhances both the estimate accuracy and the forecasting power. Empirical validations using various datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness in capturing memory and dynamic patterns, offering deeper insights into the non-stationary dynamics of real-world systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>publi...</summary><p>published in Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation</p></details> |

While machine learning has recently been used to learn critical transitions and bifurcation structures from data, most studies remain limited as they exclusively focus on discrete-time methods and local bifurcations. To address these limitations, we use Neural Ordinary Differential Equations which provide a data-driven framework for learning system dynamics. Our results show that Neural Ordinary Differential Equations can recover underlying bifurcation structures directly from time-series data by learning parameter-dependent vector fields. Notably, we demonstrate that Neural Ordinary Differential Equations can forecast bifurcations even beyond the parameter regions represented in the training data.

Unlike conventional methods focusing on inference-time dynamics or computational efficiency, our proposed method enables structural adaptability of the computational graph during training, inspired by neuroplasticity as seen in biological systems. Each new task triggers a dynamic network adaptation, including similarity-based task identification and selective training of candidate ANN heads, which are then assessed and integrated into the model based on their performance. We evaluated our framework using three real-world multi-task demand forecasting datasets from Kaggle. We demonstrated its superior performance and consistency, achieving lower RMSE and standard deviation compared to traditional baselines and state-of-the-art multi-task learning methods.

Hyperdimensional (HD) computing, with its inherent efficiency and parallelizability, has shown promise in classification tasks but struggles to capture complex temporal patterns, while Transformers excel at sequence modeling but incur high computational and memory overhead. We introduce BiHDTrans, an efficient neurosymbolic binary hyperdimensional Transformer that integrates self-attention into the HD computing paradigm, unifying the representational efficiency of HD computing with the temporal modeling power of Transformers. Empirically, BiHDTrans outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) HD computing models by at least 14.47% and achieves 6.67% higher accuracy on average than SOTA binary Transformers. With hardware acceleration on FPGA, our pipelined implementation leverages the independent and identically distributed properties of high-dimensional representations, delivering 39.4 times lower inference latency than SOTA binary Transformers. Theoretical analysis shows that binarizing in holographic high-dimensional space incurs significantly less information distortion than directly binarizing neural networks, explaining BiHDTrans's superior accuracy. Furthermore, dimensionality experiments confirm that BiHDTrans remains competitive even with a 64% reduction in hyperspace dimensionality, surpassing SOTA binary Transformers by 1-2% in accuracy with 4.4 times less model size, as well as further reducing the latency by 49.8% compare to the full-dimensional baseline. Together, these contributions bridge the gap between the expressiveness of Transformers and the efficiency of HD computing, enabling accurate, scalable, and low-latency MTS classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[ScatterAD: Temporal-Topological Scattering Mechanism for Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24414v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One main challenge in time series anomaly detection for industrial IoT lies in the complex spatio-temporal couplings within multivariate data. However, traditional anomaly detection methods focus on modeling spatial or temporal dependencies independently, resulting in suboptimal representation learning and limited sensitivity to anomalous dispersion in high-dimensional spaces. In this work, we conduct an empirical analysis showing that both normal and anomalous samples tend to scatter in high-dimensional space, especially anomalous samples are markedly more dispersed. We formalize this dispersion phenomenon as scattering, quantified by the mean pairwise distance among sample representations, and leverage it as an inductive signal to enhance spatio-temporal anomaly detection. Technically, we propose ScatterAD to model representation scattering across temporal and topological dimensions. ScatterAD incorporates a topological encoder for capturing graph-structured scattering and a temporal encoder for constraining over-scattering through mean squared error minimization between neighboring time steps. We introduce a contrastive fusion mechanism to ensure the complementarity of the learned temporal and topological representations. Additionally, we theoretically show that maximizing the conditional mutual information between temporal and topological views improves cross-view consistency and enhances more discriminative representations. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmarks show that ScatterAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on multivariate time series anomaly detection. Code is available at this repository: https://github.com/jk-sounds/ScatterAD.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[AXIS: Explainable Time Series Anomaly Detection with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24378v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) increasingly demands explanations that articulate not only if an anomaly occurred, but also what pattern it exhibits and why it is anomalous. Leveraging the impressive explanatory capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), recent works have attempted to treat time series as text for explainable TSAD. However, this approach faces a fundamental challenge: LLMs operate on discrete tokens and struggle to directly process long, continuous signals. Consequently, naive time-to-text serialization suffers from a lack of contextual grounding and representation alignment between the two modalities. To address this gap, we introduce AXIS, a framework that conditions a frozen LLM for nuanced time-series understanding. Instead of direct serialization, AXIS enriches the LLM's input with three complementary hints derived from the series: (i) a symbolic numeric hint for numerical grounding, (ii) a context-integrated, step-aligned hint distilled from a pretrained time-series encoder to capture fine-grained dynamics, and (iii) a task-prior hint that encodes global anomaly characteristics. Furthermore, to facilitate robust evaluation of explainability, we introduce a new benchmark featuring multi-format questions and rationales that supervise contextual grounding and pattern-level semantics. Extensive experiments, including both LLM-based and human evaluations, demonstrate that AXIS yields explanations of significantly higher quality and achieves competitive detection accuracy compared to general-purpose LLMs, specialized time-series LLMs, and time-series Vision Language Models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Network inference via process motifs for lagged correlation in linear stochastic processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08871v3)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A major challenge for causal inference from time-series data is the trade-off between computational feasibility and accuracy. Motivated by process motifs for lagged covariance in an autoregressive model with slow mean-reversion, we propose to infer networks of causal relations via pairwise edge measure (PEMs) that one can easily compute from lagged correlation matrices. Motivated by contributions of process motifs to covariance and lagged variance, we formulate two PEMs that correct for confounding factors and for reverse causation. To demonstrate the performance of our PEMs, we consider network interference from simulations of linear stochastic processes, and we show that our proposed PEMs can infer networks accurately and efficiently. Specifically, for slightly autocorrelated time-series data, our approach achieves accuracies higher than or similar to Granger causality, transfer entropy, and convergent crossmapping -- but with much shorter computation time than possible with any of these methods. Our fast and accurate PEMs are easy-to-implement methods for network inference with a clear theoretical underpinning. They provide promising alternatives to current paradigms for the inference of linear models from time-series data, including Granger causality, vector-autoregression, and sparse inverse covariance estimation.</p></details> | 28 pages, 17 figures |
| **[MAESTRO : Adaptive Sparse Attention and Robust Learning for Multimodal Dynamic Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25278v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>From clinical healthcare to daily living, continuous sensor monitoring across multiple modalities has shown great promise for real-world intelligent decision-making but also faces various challenges. In this work, we introduce MAESTRO, a novel framework that overcomes key limitations of existing multimodal learning approaches: (1) reliance on a single primary modality for alignment, (2) pairwise modeling of modalities, and (3) assumption of complete modality observations. These limitations hinder the applicability of these approaches in real-world multimodal time-series settings, where primary modality priors are often unclear, the number of modalities can be large (making pairwise modeling impractical), and sensor failures often result in arbitrary missing observations. At its core, MAESTRO facilitates dynamic intra- and cross-modal interactions based on task relevance, and leverages symbolic tokenization and adaptive attention budgeting to construct long multimodal sequences, which are processed via sparse cross-modal attention. The resulting cross-modal tokens are routed through a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism, enabling black-box specialization under varying modality combinations. We evaluate MAESTRO against 10 baselines on four diverse datasets spanning three applications, and observe average relative improvements of 4% and 8% over the best existing multimodal and multivariate approaches, respectively, under complete observations. Under partial observations -- with up to 40% of missing modalities -- MAESTRO achieves an average 9% improvement. Further analysis also demonstrates the robustness and efficiency of MAESTRO's sparse, modality-aware design for learning from dynamic time series.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Neurips 2025 (Spotlight)</p></details> |
| **[U-Cast: Learning Hierarchical Structures for High-Dimensional Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15119v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting (TSF) is a central problem in time series analysis. However, as the number of channels in time series datasets scales to the thousands or more, a scenario we define as High-Dimensional Time Series Forecasting (HDTSF), it introduces significant new modeling challenges that are often not the primary focus of traditional TSF research. HDTSF is challenging because the channel correlation often forms complex and hierarchical patterns. Existing TSF models either ignore these interactions or fail to scale as dimensionality grows. To address this issue, we propose U-Cast, a channel-dependent forecasting architecture that learns latent hierarchical channel structures with an innovative query-based attention. To disentangle highly correlated channel representation, U-Cast adds a full-rank regularization during training. We also release Time-HD, the first benchmark of large, diverse, high-dimensional datasets. Our theory shows that exploiting cross-channel information lowers forecasting risk, and experiments on Time-HD demonstrate that U-Cast surpasses strong baselines in both accuracy and efficiency. Together, U-Cast and Time-HD provide a solid basis for future HDTSF research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; we release our code publicly at https://github.com/UnifiedTSAI/Time-HD-Lib</p></details> |
| **[Weight-Space Linear Recurrent Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01153v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce WARP (Weight-space Adaptive Recurrent Prediction), a simple yet powerful model that unifies weight-space learning with linear recurrence to redefine sequence modeling. Unlike conventional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) which collapse temporal dynamics into fixed-dimensional hidden states, WARP explicitly parametrizes its hidden state as the weights and biases of a distinct auxiliary neural network, and uses input differences to drive its recurrence. This brain-inspired formulation enables efficient gradient-free adaptation of the auxiliary network at test-time, in-context learning abilities, and seamless integration of domain-specific physical priors. Empirical validation shows that WARP matches or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on diverse classification tasks, featuring in the top three in 5 out of 6 real-world challenging datasets. Furthermore, extensive experiments across sequential image completion, multivariate time series forecasting, and dynamical system reconstruction demonstrate its expressiveness and generalisation capabilities. Remarkably, a physics-informed variant of our model outperforms the next best model by more than 10x. Ablation studies confirm the architectural necessity of key components, solidifying weight-space linear RNNs as a transformative paradigm for adaptive machine intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 20 figures, 16 tables</p></details> |
| **[Evaluation of Machine and Deep Learning Techniques for Cyclone Trajectory Regression and Status Classification by Time Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24146v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate cyclone forecasting is essential for minimizing loss of life, infrastructure damage, and economic disruption. Traditional numerical weather prediction models, though effective, are computationally intensive and prone to error due to the chaotic nature of atmospheric systems. This study proposes a machine learning (ML) approach to forecasting tropical cyclone trajectory and status using time series data from the National Hurricane Center, including recently added best track wind radii. A two-stage ML pipeline is developed: a regression model first predicts cyclone features maximum wind speed, minimum pressure, trajectory length, and directional change using a sliding window of historical data. These outputs are then input into classification models to predict the cyclone's categorical status. Gradient boosting regression and three classifiers random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and multilayer perceptron (MLP) are evaluated. After hyperparameter tuning and synthetic minority oversampling (SMOTE), the RF classifier achieves the highest performance with 93% accuracy, outperforming SVM and MLP across precision, recall, and F1 score. The RF model is particularly robust in identifying minority cyclone statuses and minimizing false negatives. Regression results yield low mean absolute errors, with pressure and wind predictions within about 2.2 mb and 2.4 kt, respectively. These findings demonstrate that ML models, especially ensemble-based classifiers, offer an effective, scalable alternative to traditional forecasting methods, with potential for real-time cyclone prediction and integration into decision support systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Predictive Approach To Enhance Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15217v3)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate time-series forecasting is crucial in various scientific and industrial domains, yet deep learning models often struggle to capture long-term dependencies and adapt to data distribution shifts over time. We introduce Future-Guided Learning, an approach that enhances time-series event forecasting through a dynamic feedback mechanism inspired by predictive coding. Our method involves two models: a detection model that analyzes future data to identify critical events and a forecasting model that predicts these events based on current data. When discrepancies occur between the forecasting and detection models, a more significant update is applied to the forecasting model, effectively minimizing surprise, allowing the forecasting model to dynamically adjust its parameters. We validate our approach on a variety of tasks, demonstrating a 44.8% increase in AUC-ROC for seizure prediction using EEG data, and a 23.4% reduction in MSE for forecasting in nonlinear dynamical systems (outlier excluded).By incorporating a predictive feedback mechanism, Future-Guided Learning advances how deep learning is applied to time-series forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Echo Flow Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24122v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>At the heart of time-series forecasting (TSF) lies a fundamental challenge: how can models efficiently and effectively capture long-range temporal dependencies across ever-growing sequences? While deep learning has brought notable progress, conventional architectures often face a trade-off between computational complexity and their ability to retain accumulative information over extended horizons. Echo State Networks (ESNs), a class of reservoir computing models, have recently regained attention for their exceptional efficiency, offering constant memory usage and per-step training complexity regardless of input length. This makes them particularly attractive for modeling extremely long-term event history in TSF. However, traditional ESNs fall short of state-of-the-art performance due to their limited nonlinear capacity, which constrains both their expressiveness and stability. We introduce Echo Flow Networks (EFNs), a framework composed of a group of extended Echo State Networks (X-ESNs) with MLP readouts, enhanced by our novel Matrix-Gated Composite Random Activation (MCRA), which enables complex, neuron-specific temporal dynamics, significantly expanding the network's representational capacity without compromising computational efficiency. In addition, we propose a dual-stream architecture in which recent input history dynamically selects signature reservoir features from an infinite-horizon memory, leading to improved prediction accuracy and long-term stability. Extensive evaluations on five benchmarks demonstrate that EFNs achieve up to 4x faster training and 3x smaller model size compared to leading methods like PatchTST, reducing forecasting error from 43% to 35%, a 20% relative improvement. One instantiation of our framework, EchoFormer, consistently achieves new state-of-the-art performance across five benchmark datasets: ETTh, ETTm, DMV, Weather, and Air Quality.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Recurrent Memory for Online Interdomain Gaussian Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08736v4)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel online Gaussian process (GP) model that is capable of capturing long-term memory in sequential data in an online learning setting. Our model, Online HiPPO Sparse Variational Gaussian Process (OHSVGP), leverages the HiPPO (High-order Polynomial Projection Operators) framework, which is popularized in the RNN domain due to its long-range memory modeling capabilities. We interpret the HiPPO time-varying orthogonal projections as inducing variables with time-dependent orthogonal polynomial basis functions, which allows the SVGP inducing variables to memorize the process history. We show that the HiPPO framework fits naturally into the interdomain GP framework and demonstrate that the kernel matrices can also be updated online in a recurrence form based on the ODE evolution of HiPPO. We evaluate OHSVGP with online prediction for 1D time series, continual learning in discriminative GP model for data with multidimensional inputs, and deep generative modeling with sparse Gaussian process variational autoencoder, showing that it outperforms existing online GP methods in terms of predictive performance, long-term memory preservation, and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Diffusion Generative Models Meet Compressed Sensing, with Applications to Imaging and Finance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03898v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study we develop dimension-reduction techniques to accelerate diffusion model inference in the context of synthetic data generation. The idea is to integrate compressed sensing into diffusion models (hence, CSDM): First, compress the dataset into a latent space (from an ambient space), and train a diffusion model in the latent space; next, apply a compressed sensing algorithm to the samples generated in the latent space for decoding back to the original space; and the goal is to facilitate the efficiency of both model training and inference. Under certain sparsity assumptions on data, our proposed approach achieves provably faster convergence, via combining diffusion model inference with sparse recovery. It also sheds light on the best choice of the latent space dimension. To illustrate the effectiveness of this approach, we run numerical experiments on a range of datasets, including handwritten digits, medical and climate images, and financial time series for stress testing.</p></details> |  |
| **[OrderFusion: Encoding Orderbook for End-to-End Probabilistic Intraday Electricity Price Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06830v3)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic forecasting of intraday electricity prices is essential to manage market uncertainties. However, current methods rely heavily on domain feature extraction, which breaks the end-to-end training pipeline and limits the model's ability to learn expressive representations from the raw orderbook. Moreover, these methods often require training separate models for different quantiles, further violating the end-to-end principle and introducing the quantile crossing issue. Recent advances in time-series models have demonstrated promising performance in general forecasting tasks. However, these models lack inductive biases arising from buy-sell interactions and are thus overparameterized. To address these challenges, we propose an end-to-end probabilistic model called OrderFusion, which produces interaction-aware representations of buy-sell dynamics, hierarchically estimates multiple quantiles, and remains parameter-efficient with only 4,872 parameters. We conduct extensive experiments and ablation studies on price indices (ID1, ID2, and ID3) using three years of orderbook in high-liquidity (German) and low-liquidity (Austrian) markets. The experimental results demonstrate that OrderFusion consistently outperforms multiple competitive baselines across markets, and ablation studies highlight the contribution of its individual components.

While recent advances in deep learning and foundation models have led to substantial improvements in general time series forecasting, most existing approaches fail to capture the complex spatial interdependencies and uncertainty inherent in electricity markets. In this paper, we address these limitations by introducing a comprehensive and up-to-date dataset across 24 European countries (38 regions), spanning from 2022-01-01 to 2025-01-01. Building on this groundwork, we propose PriceFM, a spatiotemporal foundation model that integrates graph-based inductive biases to capture spatial interdependencies across interconnected electricity markets. The model is designed for multi-region, multi-timestep, and multi-quantile probabilistic electricity price forecasting. Extensive experiments and ablation studies confirm the model's effectiveness, consistently outperforming competitive baselines and highlighting the importance of spatial context in electricity markets.

| **[Towards Foundation Models for Zero-Shot Time Series Anomaly Detection: Leveraging Synthetic Data and Relative Context Discrepancy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21190v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a critical task, but developing models that generalize to unseen data in a zero-shot manner remains a major challenge. Prevailing foundation models for TSAD predominantly rely on reconstruction-based objectives, which suffer from a fundamental objective mismatch: they struggle to identify subtle anomalies while often misinterpreting complex normal patterns, leading to high rates of false negatives and positives. To overcome these limitations, we introduce \texttt{TimeRCD}, a novel foundation model for TSAD built upon a new pre-training paradigm: Relative Context Discrepancy (RCD). Instead of learning to reconstruct inputs, \texttt{TimeRCD} is explicitly trained to identify anomalies by detecting significant discrepancies between adjacent time windows. This relational approach, implemented with a standard Transformer architecture, enables the model to capture contextual shifts indicative of anomalies that reconstruction-based methods often miss. To facilitate this paradigm, we develop a large-scale, diverse synthetic corpus with token-level anomaly labels, providing the rich supervisory signal necessary for effective pre-training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{TimeRCD} significantly outperforms existing general-purpose and anomaly-specific foundation models in zero-shot TSAD across diverse datasets. Our results validate the superiority of the RCD paradigm and establish a new, effective path toward building robust and generalizable foundation models for time series anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |
