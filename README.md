| **[Early Detection of Multidrug Resistance Using Multivariate Time Series Analysis and Interpretable Patient-Similarity Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17717v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background and Objectives: Multidrug Resistance (MDR) is a critical global health issue, causing increased hospital stays, healthcare costs, and mortality. This study proposes an interpretable Machine Learning (ML) framework for MDR prediction, aiming for both accurate inference and enhanced explainability. Methods: Patients are modeled as Multivariate Time Series (MTS), capturing clinical progression and patient-to-patient interactions. Similarity among patients is quantified using MTS-based methods: descriptive statistics, Dynamic Time Warping, and Time Cluster Kernel. These similarity measures serve as inputs for MDR classification via Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, with dimensionality reduction and kernel transformations improving model performance. For explainability, patient similarity networks are constructed from these metrics. Spectral clustering and t-SNE are applied to identify MDR-related subgroups and visualize high-risk clusters, enabling insight into clinically relevant patterns. Results: The framework was validated on ICU Electronic Health Records from the University Hospital of Fuenlabrada, achieving an AUC of 81%. It outperforms baseline ML and deep learning models by leveraging graph-based patient similarity. The approach identifies key risk factors -- prolonged antibiotic use, invasive procedures, co-infections, and extended ICU stays -- and reveals clinically meaningful clusters. Code and results are available at \https://github.com/oscarescuderoarnanz/DM4MTS. Conclusions: Patient similarity representations combined with graph-based analysis provide accurate MDR prediction and interpretable insights. This method supports early detection, risk factor identification, and patient stratification, highlighting the potential of explainable ML in critical care.</p></details> |  |

| **[Decentralized Time Series Classification with ROCKET Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17617v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series classification (TSC) is a critical task with applications in various domains, including healthcare, finance, and industrial monitoring. Due to privacy concerns and data regulations, Federated Learning has emerged as a promising approach for learning from distributed time series data without centralizing raw information. However, most FL solutions rely on a client-server architecture, which introduces robustness and confidentiality risks related to the distinguished role of the server, which is a single point of failure and can observe knowledge extracted from clients. To address these challenges, we propose DROCKS, a fully decentralized FL framework for TSC that leverages ROCKET (RandOm Convolutional KErnel Transform) features. In DROCKS, the global model is trained by sequentially traversing a structured path across federation nodes, where each node refines the model and selects the most effective local kernels before passing them to the successor. Extensive experiments on the UCR archive demonstrate that DROCKS outperforms state-of-the-art client-server FL approaches while being more resilient to node failures and malicious attacks. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DROCKS-7FF3/README.md.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Workshop on Federated Learning Advancements 2025, in conjunction with ECML-PKDD, WAFL25</p></details> |
| **[TarDiff: Target-Oriented Diffusion Guidance for Synthetic Electronic Health Record Time Series Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17613v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic Electronic Health Record (EHR) time-series generation is crucial for advancing clinical machine learning models, as it helps address data scarcity by providing more training data. However, most existing approaches focus primarily on replicating statistical distributions and temporal dependencies of real-world data. We argue that fidelity to observed data alone does not guarantee better model performance, as common patterns may dominate, limiting the representation of rare but important conditions. This highlights the need for generate synthetic samples to improve performance of specific clinical models to fulfill their target outcomes. To address this, we propose TarDiff, a novel target-oriented diffusion framework that integrates task-specific influence guidance into the synthetic data generation process. Unlike conventional approaches that mimic training data distributions, TarDiff optimizes synthetic samples by quantifying their expected contribution to improving downstream model performance through influence functions. Specifically, we measure the reduction in task-specific loss induced by synthetic samples and embed this influence gradient into the reverse diffusion process, thereby steering the generation towards utility-optimized data. Evaluated on six publicly available EHR datasets, TarDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by up to 20.4% in AUPRC and 18.4% in AUROC. Our results demonstrate that TarDiff not only preserves temporal fidelity but also enhances downstream model performance, offering a robust solution to data scarcity and class imbalance in healthcare analytics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Autoencoder for Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17548v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly Detection (AD) defines the task of identifying observations or events that deviate from typical - or normal - patterns, a critical capability in IT security for recognizing incidents such as system misconfigurations, malware infections, or cyberattacks. In enterprise environments like SAP HANA Cloud systems, this task often involves monitoring high-dimensional, multivariate time series (MTS) derived from telemetry and log data. With the advent of quantum machine learning offering efficient calculations in high-dimensional latent spaces, many avenues open for dealing with such complex data. One approach is the Quantum Autoencoder (QAE), an emerging and promising method with potential for application in both data compression and AD. However, prior applications of QAEs to time series AD have been restricted to univariate data, limiting their relevance for real-world enterprise systems. In this work, we introduce a novel QAE-based framework designed specifically for MTS AD towards enterprise scale. We theoretically develop and experimentally validate the architecture, demonstrating that our QAE achieves performance competitive with neural-network-based autoencoders while requiring fewer trainable parameters. We evaluate our model on datasets that closely reflect SAP system telemetry and show that the proposed QAE is a viable and efficient alternative for semisupervised AD in real-world enterprise settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering (QCE) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Tailored minimal reservoir computing: on the bidirectional connection between nonlinearities in the reservoir and in data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17503v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study how the degree of nonlinearity in the input data affects the optimal design of reservoir computers, focusing on how closely the model's nonlinearity should align with that of the data. By reducing minimal RCs to a single tunable nonlinearity parameter, we explore how the predictive performance varies with the degree of nonlinearity in the reservoir. To provide controlled testbeds, we generalize to the fractional Halvorsen system, a novel chaotic system with fractional exponents. Our experiments reveal that the prediction performance is maximized when the reservoir's nonlinearity matches the nonlinearity present in the data. In cases where multiple nonlinearities are present in the data, we find that the correlation dimension of the predicted signal is reconstructed correctly when the smallest nonlinearity is matched. We use this observation to propose a method for estimating the minimal nonlinearity in unknown time series by sweeping the reservoir exponent and identifying the transition to a successful reconstruction. Applying this method to both synthetic and real-world datasets, including financial time series, we demonstrate its practical viability. Finally, we transfer these insights to classical RC by augmenting traditional architectures with fractional, generalized reservoir states. This yields performance gains, particularly in resource-constrained scenarios such as physical reservoirs, where increasing reservoir size is impractical or economically unviable. Our work provides a principled route toward tailoring RCs to the intrinsic complexity of the systems they aim to model.</p></details> | 13 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Goal-Oriented Time-Series Forecasting: Foundation Framework Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17493v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional time-series forecasting often focuses only on minimizing prediction errors, ignoring the specific requirements of real-world applications that employ them. This paper presents a new training methodology, which allows a forecasting model to dynamically adjust its focus based on the importance of forecast ranges specified by the end application. Unlike previous methods that fix these ranges beforehand, our training approach breaks down predictions over the entire signal range into smaller segments, which are then dynamically weighted and combined to produce accurate forecasts. We tested our method on standard datasets, including a new dataset from wireless communication, and found that not only it improves prediction accuracy but also improves the performance of end application employing the forecasting model. This research provides a basis for creating forecasting systems that better connect prediction and decision-making in various practical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Time Series Models for Urban Wastewater Management: Predictive Performance, Model Complexity and Resilience](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17461v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Climate change increases the frequency of extreme rainfall, placing a significant strain on urban infrastructures, especially Combined Sewer Systems (CSS). Overflows from overburdened CSS release untreated wastewater into surface waters, posing environmental and public health risks. Although traditional physics-based models are effective, they are costly to maintain and difficult to adapt to evolving system dynamics. Machine Learning (ML) approaches offer cost-efficient alternatives with greater adaptability. To systematically assess the potential of ML for modeling urban infrastructure systems, we propose a protocol for evaluating Neural Network architectures for CSS time series forecasting with respect to predictive performance, model complexity, and robustness to perturbations. In addition, we assess model performance on peak events and critical fluctuations, as these are the key regimes for urban wastewater management. To investigate the feasibility of lightweight models suitable for IoT deployment, we compare global models, which have access to all information, with local models, which rely solely on nearby sensor readings. Additionally, to explore the security risks posed by network outages or adversarial attacks on urban infrastructure, we introduce error models that assess the resilience of models. Our results demonstrate that while global models achieve higher predictive performance, local models provide sufficient resilience in decentralized scenarios, ensuring robust modeling of urban infrastructure. Furthermore, models with longer native forecast horizons exhibit greater robustness to data perturbations. These findings contribute to the development of interpretable and reliable ML solutions for sustainable urban wastewater management. The implementation is available in our GitHub repository.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, accepted at 10th International Conference on Smart and Sustainable Technologies (SpliTech) 2025, GitHub: https://github.com/calgo-lab/resilient-timeseries-evaluation</p></details> |
| **[Transfer Learning with Foundational Models for Time Series Forecasting using Low-Rank Adaptations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11539v2)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundational Models are an emerging widely used technique of GenAI. These models are distinguished by their scalability and the ease with which they can be adapted through the exploitation of Transfer Learning. The availability of high computational power and large datasets have supported their development, achieving a high generalization capacity due to the enormous and heterogeneous amounts of data used in their initial training. These characteristics contribute to a solid base that can be adapted or adjusted to a wide range of tasks, increasing their applicability. This study proposes the methodology LLIAM, a straightforward adaptation of a kind of FM, Large Language Models, for the Time Series Forecasting task. An adequate time-series prompting schema and Low-Rank Adaptations are used to enhance the knowledge of the model with diverse time series datasets, known as the fine-tuning phase. A study divided in two stages has been performed for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. Initially, a comparison was made between the performance of LLIAM and different state-of-the-art DL algorithms, including Recurrent Neural Networks and Temporal Convolutional Networks, as well as a LLM-based method, TimeLLM. Following this, a zero-shot study is presented in order to evaluate the generalization capacity of the proposed methodology with time series datasets from unknown domains not considered in the model training. The outcomes of this investigation demonstrate the efficacy of LLIAM, highlighting that this straightforward and general approach can attain competent results without the necessity for applying complex modifications. This work also encourages the use of available resources (such as these pre-trained models) and efficient fine-tuning techniques to avoid unnecessary and costly training, narrowing the gap between the goals of traditional AI and Green AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[LSEAttention is All You Need for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23749v7)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based architectures have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing and computer vision. However, their performance in multivariate long-term forecasting often falls short compared to simpler linear baselines. Previous research has identified the traditional attention mechanism as a key factor limiting their effectiveness in this domain. To bridge this gap, we introduce LATST, a novel approach designed to mitigate entropy collapse and training instability common challenges in Transformer-based time series forecasting. We rigorously evaluate LATST across multiple real-world multivariate time series datasets, demonstrating its ability to outperform existing state-of-the-art Transformer models. Notably, LATST manages to achieve competitive performance with fewer parameters than some linear models on certain datasets, highlighting its efficiency and effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages with referencing, 1 figure, 5 tables</p></details> |

Dargana is fine-tuned to generate regularly updated classification of tree canopy cover at 10m resolution, distinguishing conifer and broadleaved tree types. Using Cornwall, UK, as a test case, the model achieves a pixel-level ROC-AUC of 0.98 and a PR-AUC of 0.83 on unseen satellite imagery. Dargana can identify fine structures like hedgerows and coppice below the training sample limit, and can track temporal changes to canopy cover such as new woodland establishment. Our results demonstrate how pre-trained Large Observation Models like EarthPT can be specialised for granular, dynamic land cover monitoring from space, providing a valuable, scalable tool for natural capital management and conservation.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, spotlight at `Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning', ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Modal Traffic Analysis: Integrating Time-Series Forecasting, Accident Prediction, and Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17232v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study proposes an integrated machine learning framework for advanced traffic analysis, combining time-series forecasting, classification, and computer vision techniques. The system utilizes an ARIMA(2,0,1) model for traffic prediction (MAE: 2.1), an XGBoost classifier for accident severity classification (100% accuracy on balanced data), and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for traffic image classification (92% accuracy). Tested on diverse datasets, the framework outperforms baseline models and identifies key factors influencing accident severity, including weather and road infrastructure. Its modular design supports deployment in smart city systems for real-time monitoring, accident prevention, and resource optimization, contributing to the evolution of intelligent transportation systems.</p></details> | 5 pages,10 figures |
| **[A general approach to modeling environmental mixtures with multivariate outcomes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17195v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An important goal of environmental health research is to assess the health risks posed by mixtures of multiple environmental exposures. In these mixtures analyses, flexible models like Bayesian kernel machine regression and multiple index models are appealing because they allow for arbitrary non-linear exposure-outcome relationships. However, this flexibility comes at the cost of low power, particularly when exposures are highly correlated and the health effects are weak, as is typical in environmental health studies. We propose an adaptive index modelling strategy that borrows strength across exposures and outcomes by exploiting similar mixture component weights and exposure-response relationships. In the special case of distributed lag models, in which exposures are measured repeatedly over time, we jointly encourage co-clustering of lag profiles and exposure-response curves to more efficiently identify critical windows of vulnerability and characterize important exposure effects. We then extend the proposed approach to the multivariate index model setting where the true index structure -- the number of indices and their composition -- is unknown, and introduce variable importance measures to quantify component contributions to mixture effects. Using time series data from the National Morbidity, Mortality and Air Pollution Study, we demonstrate the proposed methods by jointly modelling three mortality outcomes and two cumulative air pollution measurements with a maximum lag of 14 days.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Novel Hybrid Approach Using an Attention-Based Transformer + GRU Model for Predicting Cryptocurrency Prices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17079v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article, we introduce a novel deep learning hybrid model that integrates attention Transformer and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architectures to improve the accuracy of cryptocurrency price predictions. By combining the Transformer's strength in capturing long-range patterns with the GRU's ability to model short-term and sequential trends, the hybrid model provides a well-rounded approach to time series forecasting. We apply the model to predict the daily closing prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum based on historical data that include past prices, trading volumes, and the Fear and Greed index. We evaluate the performance of our proposed model by comparing it with four other machine learning models: two are non-sequential feedforward models: Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN) and General Regression Neural Network (GRNN), and two are bidirectional sequential memory-based models: Bidirectional Long-Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU). The performance of the model is assessed using several metrics, including Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), along with statistical validation through the nonparametric Friedman test followed by a post hoc Wilcoxon signed rank test. The results demonstrate that our hybrid model consistently achieves superior accuracy, highlighting its effectiveness for financial prediction tasks. These findings provide valuable insights for improving real-time decision making in cryptocurrency markets and support the growing use of hybrid deep learning models in financial analytics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Molecular Communication Channel as a Physical Reservoir Computer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17022v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular Communication (MC) channels inherently possess significant memory and nonlinear dynamics due to diffusion and receptor kinetics, often posing challenges for reliable data transmission. This work reconceptualizes these intrinsic properties as computational resources by framing a canonical point-to-point MC channel, consisting of ligand diffusion and reversible ligand-receptor binding at a spherical receiver, as a physical reservoir computer (PRC). We utilize the time-varying fraction of bound receptors as the reservoir's internal state, employing time-multiplexing to generate high-dimensional virtual nodes without explicit recurrence. Only a linear readout layer is trained via ridge regression. Through deterministic mean-field modeling and particle-based spatial stochastic simulations, we demonstrate the MC system's capability for complex temporal processing by successfully performing next-step prediction on standard chaotic time-series benchmarks (Mackey-Glass and NARMA10). Performance, quantified by Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE), exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on key system parameters (receptor kinetic rates, diffusion coefficient, transmitter-receiver distance), revealing optimal operational regimes. These findings validate the potential of using MC channel as effective and low-complexity computational substrate.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised Time-Series Signal Analysis with Autoencoders and Vision Transformers: A Review of Architectures and Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16972v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of unlabeled time-series data in domains such as wireless communications, radar, biomedical engineering, and the Internet of Things (IoT) has driven advancements in unsupervised learning. This review synthesizes recent progress in applying autoencoders and vision transformers for unsupervised signal analysis, focusing on their architectures, applications, and emerging trends. We explore how these models enable feature extraction, anomaly detection, and classification across diverse signal types, including electrocardiograms, radar waveforms, and IoT sensor data. The review highlights the strengths of hybrid architectures and self-supervised learning, while identifying challenges in interpretability, scalability, and domain generalization. By bridging methodological innovations and practical applications, this work offers a roadmap for developing robust, adaptive models for signal intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online model learning with data-assimilated reservoir computers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16767v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an online learning framework for forecasting nonlinear spatio-temporal signals (fields). The method integrates (i) dimensionality reduction, here, a simple proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) projection; (ii) a generalized autoregressive model to forecast reduced dynamics, here, a reservoir computer; (iii) online adaptation to update the reservoir computer (the model), here, ensemble sequential data assimilation.We demonstrate the framework on a wake past a cylinder governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, exploring the assimilation of full flow fields (projected onto POD modes) and sparse sensors. Three scenarios are examined: a na\"ive physical state estimation; a two-fold estimation of physical and reservoir states; and a three-fold estimation that also adjusts the model parameters. The two-fold strategy significantly improves ensemble convergence and reduces reconstruction error compared to the na\"ive approach. The three-fold approach enables robust online training of partially-trained reservoir computers, overcoming limitations of a priori training. By unifying data-driven reduced order modelling with Bayesian data assimilation, this work opens new opportunities for scalable online model learning for nonlinear time series forecasting.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |
| **[A Time Series Dataset of NIR Spectra and RGB and NIR-HSI Images of the Barley Germination Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16658v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We provide an open-source dataset of RGB and NIR-HSI (near-infrared hyperspectral imaging) images with associated segmentation masks and NIR spectra of 2242 individual malting barley kernels. We imaged every kernel pre-exposure to moisture and every 24 hours after exposure to moisture for five consecutive days. Every barley kernel was labeled as germinated or not germinated during each image acquisition. The barley kernels were imaged with black filter paper as the background, facilitating straight-forward intensity threshold-based segmentation, e.g., by Otsu's method. This dataset facilitates time series analysis of germination time for barley kernels using either RGB image analysis, NIR spectral analysis, NIR-HSI analysis, or a combination hereof.</p></details> |  |
| **[Application of Battery Storage to Switching Predictive Control of Power Distribution Systems Including Road Heating](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24104v2)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In regions with heavy snowfall, the living environment is becoming a serious problem due to heavy snow accumulation. A road heating is an electrical device which promotes snow melting by burying a heating cable as a thermal source underground in such regions. When integrating the road heating into power distribution systems, we need to optimize the flow of electric power by appropriately integrating distributed power sources and conventional power distribution equipment. In this paper, we introduce a battery storage to the power distribution system including road heating, and extend the predictive switching control of the systems due to the authors' previous study to the case where battery storage is installed. As a main result, we propose a predictive switching control that utilizes photovoltaic (PV) power generation and surplus power stored in the battery storage effectively, and achieves the reduction of distribution loss, attenuation of voltage fluctuation, and efficient snow melting, simultaneously. We verify the effectiveness of the application of battery storage through numerical simulation using actual time series data of weather conditions and active power of the PV power generation and load.</p></details> | 13 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Con4m: Context-aware Consistency Learning Framework for Segmented Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00041v3)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Classification (TSC) encompasses two settings: classifying entire sequences or classifying segmented subsequences. The raw time series for segmented TSC usually contain Multiple classes with Varying Duration of each class (MVD). Therefore, the characteristics of MVD pose unique challenges for segmented TSC, yet have been largely overlooked by existing works. Specifically, there exists a natural temporal dependency between consecutive instances (segments) to be classified within MVD. However, mainstream TSC models rely on the assumption of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), focusing on independently modeling each segment. Additionally, annotators with varying expertise may provide inconsistent boundary labels, leading to unstable performance of noise-free TSC models. To address these challenges, we first formally demonstrate that valuable contextual information enhances the discriminative power of classification instances. Leveraging the contextual priors of MVD at both the data and label levels, we propose a novel consistency learning framework Con4m, which effectively utilizes contextual information more conducive to discriminating consecutive segments in segmented TSC tasks, while harmonizing inconsistent boundary labels for training. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets validate the effectiveness of Con4m in handling segmented TSC tasks on MVD. The source code is available at https://github.com/MrNobodyCali/Con4m.</p></details> |  |

However, current deep forecasting methods can achieve promising performance but generally lack interpretability, hindering trustworthiness and practical deployment in safety-critical applications such as auto-driving and healthcare. In this paper, we propose a novel interpretable model, iTFKAN, for credible time series forecasting. iTFKAN enables further exploration of model decision rationales and underlying data patterns due to its interpretability achieved through model symbolization. Besides, iTFKAN develops two strategies, prior knowledge injection, and time-frequency synergy learning, to effectively guide model learning under complex intertwined time series data. Extensive experimental results demonstrated that iTFKAN can achieve promising forecasting performance while simultaneously possessing high interpretive capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Key results, such as the law of large numbers and the functional central limit theorem, are known for weakly dependent variables. We demonstrate the transfer of mixing properties from the exogenous regressor to the response via coupling arguments. Additionally, we study Markov chains in random environments with drift and minorization conditions, even under non-stationary environments with favorable mixing properties, and apply this framework to single-server queuing models.</p></details> | 39 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Adaptive Student's t-distribution with method of moments moving estimator for nonstationary time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03069v4)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The real life time series are usually nonstationary, bringing a difficult question of model adaptation. Classical approaches like ARMA-ARCH assume arbitrary type of dependence. To avoid their bias, we will focus on recently proposed agnostic philosophy of moving estimator: in time $t$ finding parameters optimizing e.g. $F_t=\sum_{\tau<t} (1-\eta)^{t-\tau} \ln(\rho_\theta (x_\tau))$ moving log-likelihood, evolving in time. It allows for example to estimate parameters using inexpensive exponential moving averages (EMA), like absolute central moments $m_p=E[|x-\mu|^p]$ evolving for one or multiple powers $p\in\mathbb{R}^+$ using $m_{p,t+1} = m_{p,t} + \eta (|x_t-\mu_t|^p-m_{p,t})$. Application of such general adaptive methods of moments will be presented on Student's t-distribution, popular especially in economical applications, here applied to log-returns of DJIA companies. While standard ARMA-ARCH approaches provide evolution of $\mu$ and $\sigma$, here we also get evolution of $\nu$ describing $\rho(x)\sim |x|^{-\nu-1}$ tail shape, probability of extreme events - which might turn out catastrophic, destabilizing the market.</p></details> | 7 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Multiscale detection of practically significant changes in a gradually varying time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15872v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many change point problems it is reasonable to assume that compared to a benchmark at a given time point $t_0$ the properties of the observed stochastic process change gradually over time for $t >t_0$. Often, these gradual changes are not of interest as long as they are small (nonrelevant), but one is interested in the question if the deviations are practically significant in the sense that the deviation of the process compared to the time $t_0$ (measured by an appropriate metric) exceeds a given threshold, which is of practical significance (relevant change). In this paper we develop novel and powerful change point analysis for detecting such deviations in a sequence of gradually varying means, which is compared with the average mean from a previous time period. Current approaches to this problem suffer from low power, rely on the selection of smoothing parameters and require a rather regular (smooth) development for the means. We develop a multiscale procedure that alleviates all these issues, validate it theoretically and demonstrate its good finite sample performance on both synthetic and real data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive PCA-Based Outlier Detection for Multi-Feature Time Series in Space Missions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15846v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analyzing multi-featured time series data is critical for space missions making efficient event detection, potentially onboard, essential for automatic analysis. However, limited onboard computational resources and data downlink constraints necessitate robust methods for identifying regions of interest in real time. This work presents an adaptive outlier detection algorithm based on the reconstruction error of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature reduction, designed explicitly for space mission applications. The algorithm adapts dynamically to evolving data distributions by using Incremental PCA, enabling deployment without a predefined model for all possible conditions. A pre-scaling process normalizes each feature's magnitude while preserving relative variance within feature types. We demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness in detecting space plasma events, such as distinct space environments, dayside and nightside transients phenomena, and transition layers through NASA's MMS mission observations. Additionally, we apply the method to NASA's THEMIS data, successfully identifying a dayside transient using onboard-available measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCS 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Time Series Analysis of Malware Uploads to Programming Language Ecosystems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15695v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software ecosystems built around programming languages have greatly facilitated software development. At the same time, their security has increasingly been acknowledged as a problem. To this end, the paper examines the previously overlooked longitudinal aspects of software ecosystem security, focusing on malware uploaded to six popular programming language ecosystems. The dataset examined is based on the new Open Source Vulnerabilities (OSV) database. According to the results, records about detected malware uploads in the database have recently surpassed those addressing vulnerabilities in packages distributed in the ecosystems. In the early 2025 even up to 80% of all entries in the OSV have been about malware. Regarding time series analysis of malware frequencies and their shares to all database entries, good predictions are available already by relatively simple autoregressive models using the numbers of ecosystems, security advisories, and media and other articles as predictors.

Recent studies have explored transfer learning for independent observations in complex, high-dimensional models assuming sparsity, yet research on time series models remains limited. Our focus is on transfer learning for sequences of observations with temporal dependencies and a more intricate model parameter structure. Specifically, we investigate the vector autoregressive model (VAR), a widely recognized model for time series data, where the transition matrix can be deconstructed into a combination of a sparse matrix and a low-rank one. We propose a new transfer learning algorithm tailored for estimating high-dimensional VAR models characterized by low-rank and sparse structures. Additionally, we present a novel approach for selecting informative observations from auxiliary datasets. Theoretical guarantees are established, encompassing model parameter consistency, informative set selection, and the asymptotic distribution of estimators under mild conditions. The latter facilitates the construction of entry-wise confidence intervals for model parameters. Finally, we demonstrate the empirical efficacy of our methodologies through both simulated and real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages accepted by AISTATS2025</p></details> |
| **[On testing for independence between generalized error models of several time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24003v2)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We define generalized innovations associated with generalized error models having arbitrary distributions, that is, distributions that can be mixtures of continuous and discrete distributions. These models include stochastic volatility models and regime-switching models. We also propose statistics for testing independence between the generalized errors of these models, extending previous results of Duchesne, Ghoudi and Remillard (2012) obtained for stochastic volatility models. We define families of empirical processes constructed from lagged generalized errors, and we show that their joint asymptotic distributions are Gaussian and independent of the estimated parameters of the individual time series. Moebius transformations of the empirical processes are used to obtain tractable covariances. Several tests statistics are then proposed, based on Cramer-von Mises statistics and dependence measures, as well as graphical methods to visualize the dependence. In addition, numerical experiments are performed to assess the power of the proposed tests. Finally, to show the usefulness of our methodologies, examples of applications for financial data and crime data are given to cover both discrete and continuous cases. ll developed methodologies are implemented in the CRAN package IndGenErrors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint leave-group-out cross-validation in Bayesian spatial models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15586v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-validation (CV) is a widely-used method of predictive assessment based on repeated model fits to different subsets of the available data. CV is applicable in a wide range of statistical settings. However, in cases where data are not exchangeable, the design of CV schemes should account for suspected correlation structures within the data. CV scheme designs include the selection of left-out blocks and the choice of scoring function for evaluating predictive performance. This paper focuses on the impact of two scoring strategies for block-wise CV applied to spatial models with Gaussian covariance structures. We investigate, through several experiments, whether evaluating the predictive performance of blocks of left-out observations jointly, rather than aggregating individual (pointwise) predictions, improves model selection performance. Extending recent findings for data with serial correlation (such as time-series data), our experiments suggest that joint scoring reduces the variability of CV estimates, leading to more reliable model selection, particularly when spatial dependence is strong and model differences are subtle.</p></details> |  |

This disconnect between causal methodology and practical usability presents a dual challenge: domain experts are unable to leverage recent advances in causal learning, while causal researchers lack broad, real-world deployment to test and refine their methods. To address this, we introduce Causal-Copilot, an autonomous agent that operationalizes expert-level causal analysis within a large language model framework. Causal-Copilot automates the full pipeline of causal analysis for both tabular and time-series data -- including causal discovery, causal inference, algorithm selection, hyperparameter optimization, result interpretation, and generation of actionable insights. It supports interactive refinement through natural language, lowering the barrier for non-specialists while preserving methodological rigor. By integrating over 20 state-of-the-art causal analysis techniques, our system fosters a virtuous cycle -- expanding access to advanced causal methods for domain experts while generating rich, real-world applications that inform and advance causal theory. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Causal-Copilot achieves superior performance compared to existing baselines, offering a reliable, scalable, and extensible solution that bridges the gap between theoretical sophistication and real-world applicability in causal analysis. A live interactive demo of Causal-Copilot is available at https://causalcopilot.com/.</p></details> |  |

Anomaly detection is crucial for such systems to facilitate predictive maintenance. However, most existing anomaly detection methods are designed for either univariate or single-system multivariate data, making them insufficient for these complex scenarios. To address this, we introduce M$^2$AD, a framework for unsupervised anomaly detection in multivariate time series data from multiple systems. M$^2$AD employs deep models to capture expected behavior under normal conditions, using the residuals as indicators of potential anomalies. These residuals are then aggregated into a global anomaly score through a Gaussian Mixture Model and Gamma calibration. We theoretically demonstrate that this framework can effectively address heterogeneity and dependencies across sensors and systems. Empirically, M$^2$AD outperforms existing methods in extensive evaluations by 21% on average, and its effectiveness is demonstrated on a large-scale real-world case study on 130 assets in Amazon Fulfillment Centers.

A sequence pattern mining algorithm is proposed by integrating Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) with a multi-scale attention mechanism. The BiLSTM captures both forward and backward dependencies in sequences, enhancing the model's ability to perceive global contextual structures. At the same time, the multi-scale attention module assigns adaptive weights to key feature regions under different window sizes. This improves the model's responsiveness to both local and global important information. Extensive experiments are conducted on a publicly available multivariate time series dataset. The proposed model is compared with several mainstream sequence modeling methods. Results show that it outperforms existing models in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. This confirms the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed architecture in complex pattern recognition tasks. Further ablation studies and sensitivity analyses are carried out to investigate the effects of attention scale and input sequence length on model performance. These results provide empirical support for structural optimization of the model.</p></details> |  |

However, the mobility demand for our devices naturally imposes constraints on their computational and communication capabilities. A solution is to locally learn knowledge from data captured by ubiquitous devices, rather than to store and transmit the data in its original form. In this paper, we develop a federated learning framework, called Centaur, to incorporate on-device data selection at the edge, which allows partition-based training of a deep neural nets through collaboration between constrained and resourceful devices within the multidevice ecosystem of the same user. We benchmark on five neural net architecture and six datasets that include image data and wearable sensor time series. On average, Centaur achieves ~19% higher classification accuracy and ~58% lower federated training latency, compared to the baseline. We also evaluate Centaur when dealing with imbalanced non-iid data, client participation heterogeneity, and different mobility patterns. To encourage further research in this area, we release our code at https://github.com/nokia-bell-labs/data-centric-federated-learning</p></details> | <details><summary>An ea...</summary><p>An early version (v3) has been presented at ICLR 2023 Workshop on Machine Learning for IoT: Datasets, Perception, and Understanding</p></details> |
| **[Learning Compositional Transferability of Time Series for Source-Free Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14994v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain adaptation is challenging for time series classification due to the highly dynamic nature. This study tackles the most difficult subtask when both target labels and source data are inaccessible, namely, source-free domain adaptation. To reuse the classification backbone pre-trained on source data, time series reconstruction is a sound solution that aligns target and source time series by minimizing the reconstruction errors of both. However, simply fine-tuning the source pre-trained reconstruction model on target data may lose the learnt priori, and it struggles to accommodate domain varying temporal patterns in a single encoder-decoder. Therefore, this paper tries to disentangle the composition of domain transferability by using a compositional architecture for time series reconstruction. Here, the preceding component is a U-net frozen since pre-trained, the output of which during adaptation is the initial reconstruction of a given target time series, acting as a coarse step to prompt the subsequent finer adaptation. The following pipeline for finer adaptation includes two parallel branches: The source replay branch using a residual link to preserve the output of U-net, and the offset compensation branch that applies an additional autoencoder (AE) to further warp U-net's output. By deploying a learnable factor on either branch to scale their composition in the final output of reconstruction, the data transferability is disentangled and the learnt reconstructive capability from source data is retained. During inference, aside from the batch-level optimization in the training, we search at test time stability-aware rescaling of source replay branch to tolerate instance-wise variation. The experimental results show that such compositional architecture of time series reconstruction leads to SOTA performance on 3 widely used benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Corre...</summary><p>Corresponding author: Su Yang</p></details> |

Our architecture aims to learn effective representations at many scales across all available data simultaneously. The model contains a number of novel modules: a differentiated form of time series patching which employs multiple resolutions, a multiple-resolution module for time-varying known variables, a mixer-based module for capturing cross-series information, and a novel output head with favourable scaling to account for the increased number of tokens. We present an application of this model to a real world prediction problem faced by the markdown team at a very large retailer. On the experiments conducted our model outperforms in-house models and the selected existing deep learning architectures.</p></details> |  |

The Simple Cycle Reservoir (SCR) is an RC model that stands out for its minimalistic design, offering extremely low construction complexity and proven capability of universally approximating time-invariant causal fading memory filters, even in the linear dynamics regime. This paper introduces Multiple Simple Cycle Reservoirs (MSCRs), a multi-reservoir framework that extends Echo State Networks (ESNs) by replacing a single large reservoir with multiple interconnected SCRs. We demonstrate that optimizing MSCR using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) outperforms existing multi-reservoir models, achieving competitive predictive performance with a lower-dimensional state space. By modeling interconnections as a weighted Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), our approach enables flexible, task-specific network topology adaptation. Numerical simulations on three benchmark time-series prediction tasks confirm these advantages over rival algorithms. These findings highlight the potential of MSCR-PSO as a promising framework for optimizing multi-reservoir systems, providing a foundation for further advancements and applications of interconnected SCRs for developing efficient AI devices.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce the forecasting problem from textual time series, where timestamped clinical findings -- extracted via an LLM-assisted annotation pipeline -- serve as the primary input for prediction. We systematically evaluate a diverse suite of models, including fine-tuned decoder-based large language models and encoder-based transformers, on tasks of event occurrence prediction, temporal ordering, and survival analysis. Our experiments reveal that encoder-based models consistently achieve higher F1 scores and superior temporal concordance for short- and long-horizon event forecasting, while fine-tuned masking approaches enhance ranking performance. In contrast, instruction-tuned decoder models demonstrate a relative advantage in survival analysis, especially in early prognosis settings. Our sensitivity analyses further demonstrate the importance of time ordering, which requires clinical time series construction, as compared to text ordering, the format of the text inputs that LLMs are classically trained on. This highlights the additional benefit that can be ascertained from time-ordered corpora, with implications for temporal tasks in the era of widespread LLM use.</p></details> | <details><summary>Machi...</summary><p>Machine Learning for Healthcare (MLHC 2025)</p></details> |

We present the first comprehensive study investigating these models' temporal plasticity - their ability to progressively enhance performance through continual learning while maintaining existing capabilities. Through experiments on real-world datasets exhibiting distribution shifts, we evaluate both conventional deep learning models and foundation models using a novel continual learning framework. Our findings reveal that while traditional models struggle with performance deterioration during incremental fine-tuning, foundation models like Time-MoE and Chronos demonstrate sustained improvement in predictive accuracy. This suggests that optimizing foundation model fine-tuning strategies may be more valuable than developing domain-specific small models. Our research introduces new evaluation methodologies and insights for developing foundation time series models with robust continuous learning capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IJCNN 2025</p></details> |

Our approach combines two trend estimation methods: the Hodrick Prescott (HP) filter and the l1 filter. A major challenge in these methods is selecting the tuning parameter lambda, which we address by introducing two selection techniques. For the HP based change point detection, we propose a probability-based threshold to select lambda under the assumption of an exponential distribution. For the l1 based method, we suggest a selection strategy assuming normality. Additionally, we introduce a technique to estimate the maximum number of change points in time segments using the l1 based method. We validate our methods by comparing them to similar techniques, such as PELT, using simulated data. We also demonstrate the practical application of our approach to real-world SNP stock data, showcasing its effectiveness in detecting change points.</p></details> | <details><summary>Need ...</summary><p>Need to major review the research proof section</p></details> |
| **[Universal time-series forecasting with mixture predictors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00297v2)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This book is devoted to the problem of sequential probability forecasting, that is, predicting the probabilities of the next outcome of a growing sequence of observations given the past. This problem is considered in a very general setting that unifies commonly used probabilistic and non-probabilistic settings, trying to make as few as possible assumptions on the mechanism generating the observations. A common form that arises in various formulations of this problem is that of mixture predictors, which are formed as a combination of a finite or infinite set of other predictors attempting to combine their predictive powers. The main subject of this book are such mixture predictors, and the main results demonstrate the universality of this method in a very general probabilistic setting, but also show some of its limitations. While the problems considered are motivated by practical applications, involving, for example, financial, biological or behavioural data, this motivation is left implicit and all the results exposed are theoretical. The book targets graduate students and researchers interested in the problem of sequential prediction, and, more generally, in theoretical analysis of problems in machine learning and non-parametric statistics, as well as mathematical and philosophical foundations of these fields. The material in this volume is presented in a way that presumes familiarity with basic concepts of probability and statistics, up to and including probability distributions over spaces of infinite sequences. Familiarity with the literature on learning or stochastic processes is not required.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the author's version of the book published by Springer under the same name.

| **[Pets: General Pattern Assisted Architecture For Time Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14209v2)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis has found widespread applications in areas such as weather forecasting, anomaly detection, and healthcare. However, real-world sequential data often exhibit a superimposed state of various fluctuation patterns, including hourly, daily, and monthly frequencies. Traditional decomposition techniques struggle to effectively disentangle these multiple fluctuation patterns from the seasonal components, making time series analysis challenging. Surpassing the existing multi-period decoupling paradigms, this paper introduces a novel perspective based on energy distribution within the temporal-spectrum space. By adaptively quantifying observed sequences into continuous frequency band intervals, the proposed approach reconstructs fluctuation patterns across diverse periods without relying on domain-specific prior knowledge. Building upon this innovative strategy, we propose Pets, an enhanced architecture that is adaptable to arbitrary model structures. Pets integrates a Fluctuation Pattern Assisted (FPA) module and a Context-Guided Mixture of Predictors (MoP). The FPA module facilitates information fusion among diverse fluctuation patterns by capturing their dependencies and progressively modeling these patterns as latent representations at each layer. Meanwhile, the MoP module leverages these compound pattern representations to guide and regulate the reconstruction of distinct fluctuations hierarchically. Pets achieves state-of-the-art performance across various tasks, including forecasting, imputation, anomaly detection, and classification, while demonstrating strong generalization and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decomposition-based multi-scale transformer framework for time series anomaly detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14206v1)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection is crucial for maintaining stable systems. Existing methods face two main challenges. First, it is difficult to directly model the dependencies of diverse and complex patterns within the sequences. Second, many methods that optimize parameters using mean squared error struggle with noise in the time series, leading to performance deterioration. To address these challenges, we propose a transformer-based framework built on decomposition (TransDe) for multivariate time series anomaly detection. The key idea is to combine the strengths of time series decomposition and transformers to effectively learn the complex patterns in normal time series data. A multi-scale patch-based transformer architecture is proposed to exploit the representative dependencies of each decomposed component of the time series. Furthermore, a contrastive learn paradigm based on patch operation is proposed, which leverages KL divergence to align the positive pairs, namely the pure representations of normal patterns between different patch-level views. A novel asynchronous loss function with a stop-gradient strategy is further introduced to enhance the performance of TransDe effectively. It can avoid time-consuming and labor-intensive computation costs in the optimization process. Extensive experiments on five public datasets are conducted and TransDe shows superiority compared with twelve baselines in terms of F1 score. Our code is available at https://github.com/shaieesss/TransDe.</p></details> |  |
| **[DConAD: A Differencing-based Contrastive Representation Learning Framework for Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14204v1)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection holds notable importance for risk identification and fault detection across diverse application domains. Unsupervised learning methods have become popular because they have no requirement for labels. However, due to the challenges posed by the multiplicity of abnormal patterns, the sparsity of anomalies, and the growth of data scale and complexity, these methods often fail to capture robust and representative dependencies within the time series for identifying anomalies. To enhance the ability of models to capture normal patterns of time series and avoid the retrogression of modeling ability triggered by the dependencies on high-quality prior knowledge, we propose a differencing-based contrastive representation learning framework for time series anomaly detection (DConAD). Specifically, DConAD generates differential data to provide additional information about time series and utilizes transformer-based architecture to capture spatiotemporal dependencies, which enhances the robustness of unbiased representation learning ability. Furthermore, DConAD implements a novel KL divergence-based contrastive learning paradigm that only uses positive samples to avoid deviation from reconstruction and deploys the stop-gradient strategy to compel convergence. Extensive experiments on five public datasets show the superiority and effectiveness of DConAD compared with nine baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/shaieesss/DConAD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Model Enhanced Particle Swarm Optimization for Hyperparameter Tuning for Deep Learning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14126v1)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Determining the ideal architecture for deep learning models, such as the number of layers and neurons, is a difficult and resource-intensive process that frequently relies on human tuning or computationally costly optimization approaches. While Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Large Language Models (LLMs) have been individually applied in optimization and deep learning, their combined use for enhancing convergence in numerical optimization tasks remains underexplored. Our work addresses this gap by integrating LLMs into PSO to reduce model evaluations and improve convergence for deep learning hyperparameter tuning. The proposed LLM-enhanced PSO method addresses the difficulties of efficiency and convergence by using LLMs (particularly ChatGPT-3.5 and Llama3) to improve PSO performance, allowing for faster achievement of target objectives. Our method speeds up search space exploration by substituting underperforming particle placements with best suggestions offered by LLMs. Comprehensive experiments across three scenarios -- (1) optimizing the Rastrigin function, (2) using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for time series regression, and (3) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for material classification -- show that the method significantly improves convergence rates and lowers computational costs. Depending on the application, computational complexity is lowered by 20% to 60% compared to traditional PSO methods. Llama3 achieved a 20% to 40% reduction in model calls for regression tasks, whereas ChatGPT-3.5 reduced model calls by 60% for both regression and classification tasks, all while preserving accuracy and error rates. This groundbreaking methodology offers a very efficient and effective solution for optimizing deep learning models, leading to substantial computational performance improvements across a wide range of applications.</p></details> |  |

Despite extensive research, accurately forecasting environmental change trends to inform targeted policies and assess prediction efficiency remains elusive. Conventional methods for multivariate time series (MTS) analysis often fail to capture the complex dynamics of environmental change. To address this, we introduce an innovative meta-learning MTS model, MMformer with Adaptive Transferable Multi-head Attention (ATMA), which combines self-attention and meta-learning for enhanced MTS forecasting. Specifically, MMformer is used to model and predict the time series of seven air quality indicators across 331 cities in China from January 2018 to June 2021 and the time series of precipitation and temperature at 2415 monitoring sites during the summer (276 days) from 2012 to 2014, validating the network's ability to perform and forecast MTS data successfully. Experimental results demonstrate that in these datasets, the MMformer model reaching SOTA outperforms iTransformer, Transformer, and the widely used traditional time series prediction algorithm SARIMAX in the prediction of MTS, reducing by 50\% in MSE, 20\% in MAE as compared to others in air quality datasets, reducing by 20\% in MAPE except SARIMAX. Compared with Transformer and SARIMAX in the climate datasets, MSE, MAE, and MAPE are decreased by 30\%, and there is an improvement compared to iTransformer. This approach represents a significant advance in our ability to forecast and respond to dynamic environmental quality challenges in diverse urban and rural environments. Its predictive capabilities provide valuable public health and environmental quality information, informing targeted interventions.</p></details> |  |

Transformers have remarkable success mostly in natural language processing using attention mechanism, which also influenced the time series community. The ability to capture both short and long-range dependencies helps to understand the financial market and to recognize price patterns, leading to successful applications of Transformers in stock prediction. Although, the previous research predominantly focuses on individual features and singular predictions, that limits the model's ability to understand broader market trends. In reality, within sectors such as finance and technology, companies belonging to the same industry often exhibit correlated stock price movements. In this paper, we develop a novel neural network architecture by integrating Time2Vec with the Encoder of the Transformer model. Based on the study of different markets, we propose a novel correlation feature selection method. Through a comprehensive fine-tuning of multiple hyperparameters, we conduct a comparative analysis of our results against benchmark models. We conclude that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art encoding methods such as positional encoding, and we also conclude that selecting correlation features enhance the accuracy of predicting multiple stock prices.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, currently under review at Eusipco 2025</p></details> |
| **[A theory of generalised coordinates for stochastic differential equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15532v2)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic differential equations are ubiquitous modelling tools in physics and the sciences. In most modelling scenarios, random fluctuations driving dynamics or motion have some non-trivial temporal correlation structure, which renders the SDE non-Markovian; a phenomenon commonly known as ``colored'' noise. Thus, an important objective is to develop effective tools for mathematically and numerically studying (possibly non-Markovian) SDEs. In this report, we formalise a mathematical theory for analysing and numerically studying SDEs based on so-called `generalised coordinates of motion'. Like the theory of rough paths, we analyse SDEs pathwise for any given realisation of the noise, not solely probabilistically. Like the established theory of Markovian realisation, we realise non-Markovian SDEs as a Markov process in an extended space. Unlike the established theory of Markovian realisation however, the Markovian realisations here are accurate on short timescales and may be exact globally in time, when flows and fluctuations are analytic. This theory is exact for SDEs with analytic flows and fluctuations, and is approximate when flows and fluctuations are differentiable. It provides useful analysis tools, which we employ to solve linear SDEs with analytic fluctuations. It may also be useful for studying rougher SDEs, as these may be identified as the limit of smoother ones. This theory supplies effective, computationally straightforward methods for simulation, filtering and control of SDEs; amongst others, we re-derive generalised Bayesian filtering, a state-of-the-art method for time-series analysis. Looking forward, this report suggests that generalised coordinates have far-reaching applications throughout stochastic differential equations.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages of main; 47 pages including abstract, TOC, Appendix and references</p></details> |

Specifically, the original na\"ive forecast is adjusted by a weighted movement prediction term, where the weights are determined via two parameters derived from the in-sample data: one based on directional accuracy of the movement prediction and the other on the mean absolute increment of the target series. Simulation experiments were conducted across four types of synthetic symmetric random walk series, each with different variance structures. For each time series, diverse movement predictions with predefined directional accuracies were randomly generated, and the resulting forecasts were evaluated via the RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and sMAPE metrics. The results demonstrated a clear monotonic improvement in the forecast performance as the directional accuracy increased. Notably, the adjusted na\"ive forecast achieved statistically significant improvements even at relatively low directional accuracy levels slightly above 0.50. These findings imply that the movement-prediction-adjusted na\"ive forecast can serve as an effective second-stage method for forecasting symmetric random walk time series when consistent and accurate movement predictions are provided.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Transformers for Tabular Data Time Series Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07566v2)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tabular data generation has recently attracted a growing interest due to its different application scenarios. However, generating time series of tabular data, where each element of the series depends on the others, remains a largely unexplored domain. This gap is probably due to the difficulty of jointly solving different problems, the main of which are the heterogeneity of tabular data (a problem common to non-time-dependent approaches) and the variable length of a time series. In this paper, we propose a Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) based approach for tabular data series generation. Inspired by the recent success of DiTs in image and video generation, we extend this framework to deal with heterogeneous data and variable-length sequences.

The Metropolitan Interstate Traffic Volume (MITV) dataset was used for the experiments and compared and analysed with typical LSTM-attention models, CNN-attention models and LSTM-CNN models. The experimental results show that the MSTIM model achieves better results in the metrics of Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Square Error (MSE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), which significantly improves the accuracy and stability of the traffic volume prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Local Representation Alignment RNNs Solve Temporal Tasks?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13531v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are commonly used for real-time processing, streaming data, and cases where the amount of training samples is limited. Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) is the predominant algorithm for training RNNs; however, it is frequently criticized for being prone to exploding and vanishing gradients and being biologically implausible. In this paper, we present and evaluate a target propagation-based method for RNNs, which uses local updates and seeks to reduce the said instabilities. Having stable RNN models increases their practical use in a wide range of fields such as natural language processing, time-series forecasting, anomaly detection, control systems, and robotics. The proposed solution uses local representation alignment (LRA). We thoroughly analyze the performance of this method, experiment with normalization and different local error functions, and invalidate certain assumptions about the behavior of this type of learning. Namely, we demonstrate that despite the decomposition of the network into sub-graphs, the model still suffers from vanishing gradients. We also show that gradient clipping as proposed in LRA has little to no effect on network performance. This results in an LRA RNN model that is very difficult to train due to vanishing gradients. We address this by introducing gradient regularization in the direction of the update and demonstrate that this modification promotes gradient flow and meaningfully impacts convergence. We compare and discuss the performance of the algorithm, and we show that the regularized LRA RNN considerably outperforms the unregularized version on three landmark tasks: temporal order, 3-bit temporal order, and random permutation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physical Data Embedding for Memory Efficient AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14504v3)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved exceptional performance across various fields by learning complex, nonlinear mappings from large-scale datasets. However, they face challenges such as high memory requirements and computational costs with limited interpretability. This paper introduces an approach where master equations of physics are converted into multilayered networks that are trained via backpropagation. The resulting general-purpose model effectively encodes data in the properties of the underlying physical system. In contrast to existing methods wherein a trained neural network is used as a computationally efficient alternative for solving physical equations, our approach directly treats physics equations as trainable models. We demonstrate this physical embedding concept with the Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation (NLSE), which acts as trainable architecture for learning complex patterns including nonlinear mappings and memory effects from data. The network embeds data representation in orders of magnitude fewer parameters than conventional neural networks when tested on time series data. Notably, the trained "Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Network" is interpretable, with all parameters having physical meanings. This interpretability offers insight into the underlying dynamics of the system that produced the data. The proposed method of replacing traditional DNN feature learning architectures with physical equations is also extended to the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation, demonstrating the broad applicability of the framework to other master equations of physics. Among our results, an ablation study quantifies the relative importance of physical terms such as dispersion, nonlinearity, and potential energy for classification accuracy. We also outline the limitations of this approach as it relates to generalizability.</p></details> |  |

To accurately identify causal connectivity for such specified objectives, it is necessary to properly address the influence of all other nodes within the network. The proposed procedure herein starts with the estimation of a low-dimensional representation of the other nodes in the network utilizing (frequency-domain-based) spectral dynamic principal component analysis (sDPCA). The resulting scores can then be removed from the nodes of interest, thus eliminating the confounding effect of other nodes within the HDN. Accordingly, causal interactions can be dissected between nodes that are isolated from the effects of the network. Extensive simulations have demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach as a tool for causality analysis in complex time series networks. The proposed methodology has also been shown to be applicable to multichannel EEG networks.</p></details> |  |

To study a specific scenario, including patient-specific cases, model parameter sets must be found that accurately reproduce the dynamics of interest. To facilitate this complex and time-consuming process, we present an interactive browser-based tool that uses the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm implemented in JavaScript and taking advantage of the WebGL API for hardware acceleration. Our tool allows rapid customization and can find low-error fittings to user-provided voltage time series or action potential duration data from multiple cycle lengths in a few iterations (10-32), corresponding to a runtime of a few seconds on most machines. Additionally, our tool focuses on ease of use and flexibility, providing a webpage interface that allows users to select a subset of parameters to fit, set the range of values each parameter is allowed to assume, and control the PSO algorithm hyperparameters. We demonstrate our tool's utility by fitting a variety of models to different datasets, showing how convergence is affected by model choice, dataset properties, and PSO algorithmic settings, and explaining new insights gained about the physiological and dynamical roles of the model parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Darby...</summary><p>Darby I.

We demonstrate that the Riemannian geometry induced from weighted Hardy norms for the smooth transformations of its transfer function is a K\"ahler manifold. In this setting, the K\"ahler potential of the linear system geometry corresponds to the squared weighted Hardy norm of the composite transfer function. With the inherent structure of K\"ahler manifolds, geometric quantities on the manifold of linear systems in weighted Hardy spaces can be computed more efficiently and elegantly. Moreover, this generalized framework unifies a variety of well-known information manifolds within the structure of K\"ahler information manifolds for signal filters. Several illustrative examples from time series models are provided, wherein the metric tensor, Levi-Civita connection, and K\"ahler potentials are explicitly expressed in terms of polylogarithmic functions of the poles and zeros of transfer functions parameterized by weight vectors.</p></details> | 23 pages |

While the ARAT is commonly used to assess upper limb motor function, its limitations include subjectivity and time consumption of clinical staff. By using IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors and MiniROCKET as a time series classification technique, this investigation aims to classify ARAT items based on sensor recordings. We test common preprocessing strategies to efficiently leverage included information in the data. Afterward, we use the best preprocessing to improve the classification. The dataset includes recordings of 45 participants performing various ARAT items. Results show that MiniROCKET offers a fast and reliable approach for classifying ARAT domains, although challenges remain in distinguishing between individual resembling items. Future work may involve improving classification through more advanced machine-learning models and data enhancements.</p></details> |  |

The proposed framework consists of learnable prior distributions for low-dimensional graph representations and of a decoder that bridges the observed graphs and latent representations. The prior distributions of the latent spaces are learned from the observed data as empirical Bayes to assist change point detection. Specifically, the model parameters are estimated via maximum approximate likelihood, with a Group Fused Lasso regularization imposed on the prior parameters. The augmented Lagrangian is solved via Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers, and Langevin Dynamics are recruited for posterior inference. Simulation studies show good performance of the latent space model in supporting change point detection and real data experiments yield change points that align with significant events.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeCapsule: Solving the Jigsaw Puzzle of Long-Term Time Series Forecasting with Compressed Predictive Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12721v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent deep learning models for Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF) often emphasize complex, handcrafted designs, while simpler architectures like linear models or MLPs have often outperformed these intricate solutions. In this paper, we revisit and organize the core ideas behind several key techniques, such as redundancy reduction and multi-scale modeling, which are frequently employed in advanced LTSF models. Our goal is to streamline these ideas for more efficient deep learning utilization. To this end, we introduce TimeCapsule, a model built around the principle of high-dimensional information compression that unifies these techniques in a generalized yet simplified framework. Specifically, we model time series as a 3D tensor, incorporating temporal, variate, and level dimensions, and leverage mode production to capture multi-mode dependencies while achieving dimensionality compression. We propose an internal forecast within the compressed representation domain, supported by the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA), to monitor the learning of predictive representations. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate the versatility of our method, showing that TimeCapsule can achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mean Independent Component Analysis for Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12496v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article, we introduce the mean independent component analysis for multivariate time series to reduce the parameter space. In particular, we seek for a contemporaneous linear transformation that detects univariate mean independent components so that each component can be modeled separately. The mean independent component analysis is flexible in the sense that no parametric model or distributional assumptions are made. We propose a unified framework to estimate the mean independent components from a data with a fixed dimension or a diverging dimension. We estimate the mean independent components by the martingale difference divergence so that the mean dependence across components and across time is minimized. The approach is extended to the group mean independent component analysis by imposing a group structure on the mean independent components. We further introduce a method to identify the group structure when it is unknown. The consistency of both proposed methods are established. Extensive simulations and a real data illustration for community mobility is provided to demonstrate the efficacy of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Asynchronous Graph Generator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17335v4)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the asynchronous graph generator (AGG), a novel graph attention network for imputation and prediction of multi-channel time series. Free from recurrent components or assumptions about temporal/spatial regularity, AGG encodes measurements, timestamps and channel-specific features directly in the nodes via learnable embeddings. Through an attention mechanism, these embeddings allow for discovering expressive relationships among the variables of interest in the form of a homogeneous graph. Once trained, AGG performs imputation by \emph{conditional attention generation}, i.e., by creating a new node conditioned on given timestamps and channel specification. The proposed AGG is compared to related methods in the literature and its performance is analysed from a data augmentation perspective. Our experiments reveal that AGG achieved state-of-the-art results in time series imputation, classification and prediction for the benchmark datasets \emph{Beijing Air Quality}, \emph{PhysioNet ICU 2012} and \emph{UCI localisation}, outperforming other recent attention-based networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Signal Processing</p></details> |
| **[Boosting Reservoir Computing with Brain-inspired Adaptive Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12480v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reservoir computers (RCs) provide a computationally efficient alternative to deep learning while also offering a framework for incorporating brain-inspired computational principles. By using an internal neural network with random, fixed connections$-$the 'reservoir'$-$and training only the output weights, RCs simplify the training process but remain sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters that govern activation functions and network architecture. Moreover, typical RC implementations overlook a critical aspect of neuronal dynamics: the balance between excitatory and inhibitory (E-I) signals, which is essential for robust brain function. We show that RCs characteristically perform best in balanced or slightly over-inhibited regimes, outperforming excitation-dominated ones. To reduce the need for precise hyperparameter tuning, we introduce a self-adapting mechanism that locally adjusts E/I balance to achieve target neuronal firing rates, improving performance by up to 130% in tasks like memory capacity and time series prediction compared with globally tuned RCs. Incorporating brain-inspired heterogeneity in target neuronal firing rates further reduces the need for fine-tuning hyperparameters and enables RCs to excel across linear and non-linear tasks. These results support a shift from static optimization to dynamic adaptation in reservoir design, demonstrating how brain-inspired mechanisms improve RC performance and robustness while deepening our understanding of neural computation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Lego: Model Merging and Fine-Tuning Across Topologies and Modalities in Biomedicine](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19950v2)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning holistic computational representations in physical, chemical or biological systems requires the ability to process information from different distributions and modalities within the same model. Thus, the demand for multimodal machine learning models has sharply risen for modalities that go beyond vision and language, such as sequences, graphs, time series, or tabular data. While there are many available multimodal fusion and alignment approaches, most of them require end-to-end training, scale quadratically with the number of modalities, cannot handle cases of high modality imbalance in the training set, or are highly topology-specific, making them too restrictive for many biomedical learning tasks. This paper presents Multimodal Lego (MM-Lego), a general-purpose fusion framework to turn any set of encoders into a competitive multimodal model with no or minimal fine-tuning. We achieve this by introducing a wrapper for any unimodal encoder that enforces shape consistency between modality representations. It harmonises these representations by learning features in the frequency domain to enable model merging with little signal interference. We show that MM-Lego 1) can be used as a model merging method which achieves competitive performance with end-to-end fusion models without any fine-tuning, 2) can operate on any unimodal encoder, and 3) is a model fusion method that, with minimal fine-tuning, surpasses all benchmarks in five out of seven datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[TS-ACL: Closed-Form Solution for Time Series-oriented Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15954v3)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series classification underpins critical applications such as healthcare diagnostics and gesture-driven interactive systems in multimedia scenarios. However, time series class-incremental learning (TSCIL) faces two major challenges: catastrophic forgetting and intra-class variations. Catastrophic forgetting occurs because gradient-based parameter update strategies inevitably erase past knowledge. And unlike images, time series data exhibits subject-specific patterns, also known as intra-class variations, which refer to differences in patterns observed within the same class. While exemplar-based methods fail to cover diverse variation with limited samples, existing exemplar-free methods lack explicit mechanisms to handle intra-class variations. To address these two challenges, we propose TS-ACL, which leverages a gradient-free closed-form solution to avoid the catastrophic forgetting problem inherent in gradient-based optimization methods while simultaneously learning global distributions to resolve intra-class variations. Additionally, it provides privacy protection and efficiency. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets covering various sensor modalities and tasks demonstrate that TS-ACL achieves performance close to joint training on four datasets, outperforming existing methods and establishing a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for TSCIL.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Hardware-Friendly Delayed-Feedback Reservoir for Multivariate Time-Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11981v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reservoir computing (RC) is attracting attention as a machine-learning technique for edge computing. In time-series classification tasks, the number of features obtained using a reservoir depends on the length of the input series. Therefore, the features must be converted to a constant-length intermediate representation (IR), such that they can be processed by an output layer. Existing conversion methods involve computationally expensive matrix inversion that significantly increases the circuit size and requires processing power when implemented in hardware. In this article, we propose a simple but effective IR, namely, dot-product-based reservoir representation (DPRR), for RC based on the dot product of data features. Additionally, we propose a hardware-friendly delayed-feedback reservoir (DFR) consisting of a nonlinear element and delayed feedback loop with DPRR. The proposed DFR successfully classified multivariate time series data that has been considered particularly difficult to implement efficiently in hardware. In contrast to conventional DFR models that require analog circuits, the proposed model can be implemented in a fully digital manner suitable for high-level syntheses. A comparison with existing machine-learning methods via field-programmable gate array implementation using 12 multivariate time-series classification tasks confirmed the superior accuracy and small circuit size of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

Recent approaches use Transformer architectures to model long-range dependencies via positional encoding. However, they lack accuracy in recognizing fine-grained, short-range temporal dependencies between gestures captured at high frame rates. Moreover, their high computational complexity leads to inefficient training. To mitigate these issues, we propose an Adaptive Transformer (ADAT), which incorporates components for enhanced feature extraction and adaptive feature weighting through a gating mechanism to emphasize contextually relevant features while reducing training overhead and maintaining translation accuracy. To evaluate ADAT, we introduce MedASL, the first public medical American Sign Language dataset. In sign-to-gloss-to-text experiments, ADAT outperforms the encoder-decoder transformer, improving BLEU-4 accuracy by 0.1% while reducing training time by 14.33% on PHOENIX14T and 3.24% on MedASL. In sign-to-text experiments, it improves accuracy by 8.7% and reduces training time by 2.8% on PHOENIX14T and achieves 4.7% higher accuracy and 7.17% faster training on MedASL. Compared to encoder-only and decoder-only baselines in sign-to-text, ADAT is at least 6.8% more accurate despite being up to 12.1% slower due to its dual-stream structure.</p></details> |  |

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to time series tasks, leveraging their strong language capabilities to enhance various applications. However, research on multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for time series understanding and reasoning remains limited, primarily due to the scarcity of high-quality datasets that align time series with textual information. This paper introduces ChatTS, a novel MLLM designed for time series analysis. ChatTS treats time series as a modality, similar to how vision MLLMs process images, enabling it to perform both understanding and reasoning with time series. To address the scarcity of training data, we propose an attribute-based method for generating synthetic time series with detailed attribute descriptions. We further introduce Time Series Evol-Instruct, a novel approach that generates diverse time series Q&As, enhancing the model's reasoning capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, ChatTS is the first TS-MLLM that takes multivariate time series as input for understanding and reasoning, which is fine-tuned exclusively on synthetic datasets. We evaluate its performance using benchmark datasets with real-world data, including six alignment tasks and four reasoning tasks. Our results show that ChatTS significantly outperforms existing vision-based MLLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) and text/agent-based LLMs, achieving a 46.0% improvement in alignment tasks and a 25.8% improvement in reasoning tasks. We have open-sourced the source code, model checkpoint and datasets at https://github.com/NetManAIOps/ChatTS.</p></details> | accepted by VLDB' 25 |

However, existing GPSSMs are limited by the use of multiple independent stationary Gaussian processes (GPs), leading to prohibitive computational and parametric complexity in high-dimensional settings and restricted modeling capacity for non-stationary dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient transformed Gaussian process state-space model (ETGPSSM) for scalable and flexible modeling of high-dimensional, non-stationary dynamical systems. Specifically, our ETGPSSM integrates a single shared GP with input-dependent normalizing flows, yielding an expressive implicit process prior that captures complex, non-stationary transition dynamics while significantly reducing model complexity. For the inference of the implicit process, we develop a variational inference algorithm that jointly approximates the posterior over the underlying GP and the neural network parameters defining the normalizing flows. To avoid explicit variational parameterization of the latent states, we further incorporate the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) into the variational framework, enabling accurate and efficient state estimation. Extensive empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our ETGPSSM in system dynamics learning, high-dimensional state estimation, and time-series forecasting, outperforming existing GPSSMs and neural network-based SSMs in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |

It is a paradigm of computational dynamical systems that harnesses the transient dynamics of high-dimensional state spaces for efficient processing of temporal data. Rooted in concepts from recurrent neural networks, RC achieves exceptional computational power by decoupling the training of the dynamic reservoir from the linear readout layer, thereby circumventing the complexities of gradient-based optimization. This work presents a systematic exploration of RC, addressing its foundational properties such as the echo state property, fading memory, and reservoir capacity through the lens of dynamical systems theory. We formalize the interplay between input signals and reservoir states, demonstrating the conditions under which reservoirs exhibit stability and expressive power. Further, we delve into the computational trade-offs and robustness characteristics of RC architectures, extending the discussion to their applications in signal processing, time-series prediction, and control systems. The analysis is complemented by theoretical insights into optimization, training methodologies, and scalability, highlighting open challenges and potential directions for advancing the theoretical underpinnings of RC.</p></details> | <details><summary>100 p...</summary><p>100 pages, 17 tables, 41 figures</p></details> |

Post hoc methods such as saliency maps may fail to reflect a model's true decision process. Prototype-based reasoning offers a more transparent alternative by grounding decisions in similarity to learned representations of real ECG segments, enabling faithful, case-based explanations. We introduce ProtoECGNet, a prototype-based deep learning model for interpretable, multi-label ECG classification. ProtoECGNet employs a structured, multi-branch architecture that reflects clinical interpretation workflows: it integrates a 1D CNN with global prototypes for rhythm classification, a 2D CNN with time-localized prototypes for morphology-based reasoning, and a 2D CNN with global prototypes for diffuse abnormalities. Each branch is trained with a prototype loss designed for multi-label learning, combining clustering, separation, diversity, and a novel contrastive loss that encourages appropriate separation between prototypes of unrelated classes while allowing clustering for frequently co-occurring diagnoses. We evaluate ProtoECGNet on all 71 diagnostic labels from the PTB-XL dataset, demonstrating competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art black-box models while providing structured, case-based explanations. To assess prototype quality, we conduct a structured clinician review of the final model's projected prototypes, finding that they are rated as representative and clear. ProtoECGNet shows that prototype learning can be effectively scaled to complex, multi-label time-series classification, offering a practical path toward transparent and trustworthy deep learning models for clinical decision support.</p></details> |  |

The purpose of time-series anomaly detection is to reduce potential damages or losses. However, existing anomaly detection models detect anomalies through the error between the model output and the ground truth (observed) value, which makes them impractical. In this work, we present a \textit{proactive} approach for time-series anomaly detection based on a time-series forecasting model specialized for anomaly detection and a data-driven anomaly detection model. Our proactive approach establishes an anomaly threshold from training data with a data-driven anomaly detection model, and anomalies are subsequently detected by identifying predicted values that exceed the anomaly threshold. In addition, we extensively evaluated the model using four anomaly detection benchmarks and analyzed both predictable and unpredictable anomalies.

However, structured electronic health records capture few data elements critical to these tasks, while clinical reports lack temporal localization of events in structured form. We present a system that transforms case reports into textual time series-structured pairs of textual events and timestamps. We contrast manual and large language model (LLM) annotations (n=320 and n=390 respectively) of ten randomly-sampled PubMed open-access (PMOA) case reports (N=152,974) and assess inter-LLM agreement (n=3,103; N=93). We find that the LLM models have moderate event recall(O1-preview: 0.80) but high temporal concordance among identified events (O1-preview: 0.95). By establishing the task, annotation, and assessment systems, and by demonstrating high concordance, this work may serve as a benchmark for leveraging the PMOA corpus for temporal analytics.</p></details> |  |

In this research, we explore the application of Double DQN (DDQN) and Dueling Network Architectures, to financial trading tasks using historical SP500 index data. Our focus is training agents capable of optimizing trading strategies while accounting for practical constraints such as transaction costs. The study evaluates the model performance across scenarios with and without commissions, highlighting the impact of cost-sensitive environments on reward dynamics. Despite computational limitations and the inherent complexity of financial time series data, the agent successfully learned meaningful trading policies. The findings confirm that RL agents, even when trained on limited datasets, can outperform random strategies by leveraging advanced architectures such as DDQN and Dueling Networks. However, significant challenges persist, particularly with a sub-optimal policy due to the complexity of data source.</p></details> |  |
| **[TADACap: Time-series Adaptive Domain-Aware Captioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11441v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While image captioning has gained significant attention, the potential of captioning time-series images, prevalent in areas like finance and healthcare, remains largely untapped. Existing time-series captioning methods typically offer generic, domain-agnostic descriptions of time-series shapes and struggle to adapt to new domains without substantial retraining. To address these limitations, we introduce TADACap, a retrieval-based framework to generate domain-aware captions for time-series images, capable of adapting to new domains without retraining. Building on TADACap, we propose a novel retrieval strategy that retrieves diverse image-caption pairs from a target domain database, namely TADACap-diverse. We benchmarked TADACap-diverse against state-of-the-art methods and ablation variants. TADACap-diverse demonstrates comparable semantic accuracy while requiring significantly less annotation effort.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICAIF 2024</p></details> |
