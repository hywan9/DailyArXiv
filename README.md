| **[Exposing the Impact of GenAI for Cybercrime: An Investigation into the Dark Side](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23733v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the rapid advancement and democratization of generative AI models have sparked significant debate over safety, ethical risks, and dual-use concerns, particularly in the context of cybersecurity. While anecdotally known, this paper provides empirical evidence regarding generative AI's association with malicious internet-related activities and cybercrime by examining the phenomenon through psychological frameworks of technological amplification and affordance theory. Using a quasi-experimental design with interrupted time series analysis, we analyze two datasets, one general and one cryptocurrency-focused, to empirically assess generative AI's role in cybercrime. The findings contribute to ongoing discussions about AI governance by balancing control and fostering innovation, underscoring the need for strategies to guide policymakers, inform AI developers and cybersecurity professionals, and educate the public to maximize AI's benefits while mitigating its risks.</p></details> |  |
| **[TiRex: Zero-Shot Forecasting Across Long and Short Horizons with Enhanced In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23719v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-context learning, the ability of large language models to perform tasks using only examples provided in the prompt, has recently been adapted for time series forecasting. This paradigm enables zero-shot prediction, where past values serve as context for forecasting future values, making powerful forecasting tools accessible to non-experts and increasing the performance when training data are scarce. Most existing zero-shot forecasting approaches rely on transformer architectures, which, despite their success in language, often fall short of expectations in time series forecasting, where recurrent models like LSTMs frequently have the edge. Conversely, while LSTMs are well-suited for time series modeling due to their state-tracking capabilities, they lack strong in-context learning abilities. We introduce TiRex that closes this gap by leveraging xLSTM, an enhanced LSTM with competitive in-context learning skills. Unlike transformers, state-space models, or parallelizable RNNs such as RWKV, TiRex retains state-tracking, a critical property for long-horizon forecasting. To further facilitate its state-tracking ability, we propose a training-time masking strategy called CPM. TiRex sets a new state of the art in zero-shot time series forecasting on the HuggingFace benchmarks GiftEval and Chronos-ZS, outperforming significantly larger models including TabPFN-TS (Prior Labs), Chronos Bolt (Amazon), TimesFM (Google), and Moirai (Salesforce) across both short- and long-term forecasts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Explainable Sequential Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23624v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper offers a hybrid explainable temporal data processing pipeline, DataFul Explainable MultivariatE coRrelatIonal Temporal Artificial inTElligence (EMeriTAte+DF), bridging numerical-driven temporal data classification with an event-based one through verified artificial intelligence principles, enabling human-explainable results. This was possible through a preliminary a posteriori explainable phase describing the numerical input data in terms of concurrent constituents with numerical payloads. This further required extending the event-based literature to design specification mining algorithms supporting concurrent constituents. Our previous and current solutions outperform state-of-the-art solutions for multivariate time series classifications, thus showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Time Series Forecasting via Instance-aware Post-hoc Revision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23583v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting plays a vital role in various real-world applications and has attracted significant attention in recent decades. While recent methods have achieved remarkable accuracy by incorporating advanced inductive biases and training strategies, we observe that instance-level variations remain a significant challenge. These variations--stemming from distribution shifts, missing data, and long-tail patterns--often lead to suboptimal forecasts for specific instances, even when overall performance appears strong. To address this issue, we propose a model-agnostic framework, PIR, designed to enhance forecasting performance through Post-forecasting Identification and Revision. Specifically, PIR first identifies biased forecasting instances by estimating their accuracy. Based on this, the framework revises the forecasts using contextual information, including covariates and historical time series, from both local and global perspectives in a post-processing fashion. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets with mainstream forecasting models demonstrate that PIR effectively mitigates instance-level errors and significantly improves forecasting reliability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Maximum Likelihood Learning of Latent Dynamics Without Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23569v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel unsupervised learning method for time series data with latent dynamical structure: the recognition-parametrized Gaussian state space model (RP-GSSM). The RP-GSSM is a probabilistic model that learns Markovian Gaussian latents explaining statistical dependence between observations at different time steps, combining the intuition of contrastive methods with the flexible tools of probabilistic generative models. Unlike contrastive approaches, the RP-GSSM is a valid probabilistic model learned via maximum likelihood. Unlike generative approaches, the RP-GSSM has no need for an explicit network mapping from latents to observations, allowing it to focus model capacity on inference of latents. The model is both tractable and expressive: it admits exact inference thanks to its jointly Gaussian latent prior, while maintaining expressivity with an arbitrarily nonlinear neural network link between observations and latents. These qualities allow the RP-GSSM to learn task-relevant latents without ad-hoc regularization, auxiliary losses, or optimizer scheduling. We show how this approach outperforms alternatives on problems that include learning nonlinear stochastic dynamics from video, with or without background distractors. Our results position the RP-GSSM as a useful foundation model for a variety of downstream applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Estimation of Double Autoregressive Models via Normal Mixture QMLE](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23535v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the estimation of the double autoregressive (DAR) model in the presence of skewed and heavy-tailed innovations. We propose a novel Normal Mixture Quasi-Maximum Likelihood Estimation (NM-QMLE) method to address the limitations of conventional quasi-maximum likelihood estimation (QMLE) under non-Gaussian conditions. By incorporating a normal mixture distribution into the quasi-likelihood framework, NM-QMLE effectively captures both heavy-tailed behavior and skewness. A critical contribution of this paper is addressing the often-overlooked challenge of selecting the appropriate number of mixture components, $K$, a key parameter that significantly impacts model performance. We systematically evaluate the effectiveness of different model selection criteria. Under regularity conditions, we establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the NM-QMLE estimator for DAR($p$) models. Numerical simulations demonstrate that NM-QMLE outperforms commonly adopted QMLE methods in terms of estimation accuracy, particularly when the innovation distribution deviates from normality. Our results also show that while criteria like BIC and ICL improve parameter estimation of $K$, fixing a small order of components provides comparable accuracy. To further validate its practical applicability, we apply NM-QMLE to empirical data from the S\&P 500 index and assess its performance through Value at Risk (VaR) estimation. The empirical findings highlight the effectiveness of NM-QMLE in modeling real-world financial data and improving risk assessment. By providing a robust and flexible estimation approach, NM-QMLE enhances the analysis of time series models with complex innovation structures, making it a valuable tool in econometrics and financial modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Network Weighted Functional Regression: a method for modeling dependencies between functional data in a network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18221v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper focuses on predicting continuous signals in a sensor lab network, particularly studying microclimate changes. We propose two novel concepts: Network Functional Data (NFD), which represents time series signals as functions on network nodes, and the Network Weighted Functional Regression (NWFR) model, which analyzes relationships between functional responses and predictors in a weighted network. Additionally, we introduce a functional conformal method to provide prediction bands with guaranteed coverage probabilities, independent of data distribution. Our statistical analysis on simulated and real-world data demonstrates that incorporating network structure enhances regression accuracy and improves the reliability of conformal prediction regions. These findings advance the analysis of complex network-structured data, offering a more precise and efficient approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimePoint: Accelerated Time Series Alignment via Self-Supervised Keypoint and Descriptor Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23475v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fast and scalable alignment of time series is a fundamental challenge in many domains. The standard solution, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), struggles with poor scalability and sensitivity to noise. We introduce TimePoint, a self-supervised method that dramatically accelerates DTW-based alignment while typically improving alignment accuracy by learning keypoints and descriptors from synthetic data. Inspired by 2D keypoint detection but carefully adapted to the unique challenges of 1D signals, TimePoint leverages efficient 1D diffeomorphisms, which effectively model nonlinear time warping, to generate realistic training data. This approach, along with fully convolutional and wavelet convolutional architectures, enables the extraction of informative keypoints and descriptors. Applying DTW to these sparse representations yield major speedups and typically higher alignment accuracy than standard DTW applied to the full signals. TimePoint demonstrates strong generalization to real-world time series when trained solely on synthetic data, and further improves with fine-tuning on real data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimePoint consistently achieves faster and more accurate alignments than standard DTW, making it a scalable solution for time-series analysis.

| **[Privacy Amplification by Structured Subsampling for Deep Differentially Private Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02410v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many forms of sensitive data, such as web traffic, mobility data, or hospital occupancy, are inherently sequential. The standard method for training machine learning models while ensuring privacy for units of sensitive information, such as individual hospital visits, is differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD). However, we observe in this work that the formal guarantees of DP-SGD are incompatible with time-series-specific tasks like forecasting, since they rely on the privacy amplification attained by training on small, unstructured batches sampled from an unstructured dataset. In contrast, batches for forecasting are generated by (1) sampling sequentially structured time series from a dataset, (2) sampling contiguous subsequences from these series, and (3) partitioning them into context and ground-truth forecast windows. We theoretically analyze the privacy amplification attained by this structured subsampling to enable the training of forecasting models with sound and tight event- and user-level privacy guarantees. Towards more private models, we additionally prove how data augmentation amplifies privacy in self-supervised training of sequence models. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that amplification by structured subsampling enables the training of forecasting models with strong formal privacy guarantees.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as ICML 2025 Spotlight</p></details> |
| **[BatteryLife: A Comprehensive Dataset and Benchmark for Battery Life Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18807v4)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Battery Life Prediction (BLP), which relies on time series data produced by battery degradation tests, is crucial for battery utilization, optimization, and production. Despite impressive advancements, this research area faces three key challenges. Firstly, the limited size of existing datasets impedes insights into modern battery life data. Secondly, most datasets are restricted to small-capacity lithium-ion batteries tested under a narrow range of diversity in labs, raising concerns about the generalizability of findings. Thirdly, inconsistent and limited benchmarks across studies obscure the effectiveness of baselines and leave it unclear if models popular in other time series fields are effective for BLP. To address these challenges, we propose BatteryLife, a comprehensive dataset and benchmark for BLP. BatteryLife integrates 16 datasets, offering a 2.5 times sample size compared to the previous largest dataset, and provides the most diverse battery life resource with batteries from 8 formats, 59 chemical systems, 9 operating temperatures, and 421 charge/discharge protocols, including both laboratory and industrial tests. Notably, BatteryLife is the first to release battery life datasets of zinc-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries, and industry-tested large-capacity lithium-ion batteries. With the comprehensive dataset, we revisit the effectiveness of baselines popular in this and other time series fields. Furthermore, we propose CyclePatch, a plug-in technique that can be employed in various neural networks. Extensive benchmarking of 18 methods reveals that models popular in other time series fields can be unsuitable for BLP, and CyclePatch consistently improves model performance establishing state-of-the-art benchmarks. Moreover, BatteryLife evaluates model performance across aging conditions and domains. BatteryLife is available at https://github.com/Ruifeng-Tan/BatteryLife.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2025 |
| **[State Space Model Programming in Turing.jl](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23302v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State space models (SSMs) are a powerful and widely-used class of probabilistic models for analysing time-series data across various fields, from econometrics to robotics. Despite their prevalence, existing software frameworks for SSMs often lack compositionality and scalability, hindering experimentation and making it difficult to leverage advanced inference techniques. This paper introduces SSMProblems.jl and GeneralisedFilters.jl, two Julia packages within the Turing.jl ecosystem, that address this challenge by providing a consistent, composable, and general framework for defining SSMs and performing inference on them. This unified interface allows researchers to easily define a wide range of SSMs and apply various inference algorithms, including Kalman filtering, particle filtering, and combinations thereof. By promoting code reuse and modularity, our packages reduce development time and improve the reliability of SSM implementations. We prioritise scalability through efficient memory management and GPU-acceleration, ensuring that our framework can handle large-scale inference tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 6 figures, Presented at LAFI (Languages for Inference) Workshop, POPL 2025</p></details> |
| **[Sparseformer: a Transferable Transformer with Multi-granularity Token Sparsification for Medical Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15578v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical time series (MedTS) classification is crucial for improved diagnosis in healthcare, and yet it is challenging due to the varying granularity of patterns, intricate inter-channel correlation, information redundancy, and label scarcity. While existing transformer-based models have shown promise in time series analysis, they mainly focus on forecasting and fail to fully exploit the distinctive characteristics of MedTS data. In this paper, we introduce Sparseformer, a transformer specifically designed for MedTS classification. We propose a sparse token-based dual-attention mechanism that enables global modeling and token compression, allowing dynamic focus on the most informative tokens while distilling redundant features. This mechanism is then applied to the multi-granularity, cross-channel encoding of medical signals, capturing intra- and inter-granularity correlations and inter-channel connections. The sparsification design allows our model to handle heterogeneous inputs of varying lengths and channels directly. Further, we introduce an adaptive label encoder to address label space misalignment across datasets, equipping our model with cross-dataset transferability to alleviate the medical label scarcity issue. Our model outperforms 12 baselines across seven medical datasets under supervised learning. In the few-shot learning experiments, our model also achieves superior average results. In addition, the in-domain and cross-domain experiments among three diagnostic scenarios demonstrate our model's zero-shot learning capability. Collectively, these findings underscore the robustness and transferability of our model in various medical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>3 fig...</summary><p>3 figures, 16 pages, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[JANET: Joint Adaptive predictioN-region Estimation for Time-series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06390v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conformal prediction provides machine learning models with prediction sets that offer theoretical guarantees, but the underlying assumption of exchangeability limits its applicability to time series data. Furthermore, existing approaches struggle to handle multi-step ahead prediction tasks, where uncertainty estimates across multiple future time points are crucial. We propose JANET (Joint Adaptive predictioN-region Estimation for Time-series), a novel framework for constructing conformal prediction regions that are valid for both univariate and multivariate time series. JANET generalises the inductive conformal framework and efficiently produces joint prediction regions with controlled K-familywise error rates, enabling flexible adaptation to specific application needs. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates JANET's superior performance in multi-step prediction tasks across diverse time series datasets, highlighting its potential for reliable and interpretable uncertainty quantification in sequential data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECML Journal for Machine Learning Alternate Title: Conformalised Joint Prediction Region for Time Series</p></details> |
| **[Trajectory Generator Matching for Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23215v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately modeling time-continuous stochastic processes from irregular observations remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we leverage ideas from generative modeling of image data to push the boundary of time series generation. For this, we find new generators of SDEs and jump processes, inspired by trajectory flow matching, that have the marginal distributions of the time series of interest. Specifically, we can handle discontinuities of the underlying processes by parameterizing the jump kernel densities by scaled Gaussians that allow for closed form formulas of the corresponding Kullback-Leibler divergence in the loss. Unlike most other approaches, we are able to handle irregularly sampled time series.</p></details> |  |
| **[Less is More: Unlocking Specialization of Time Series Foundation Models via Structured Pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23195v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling laws motivate the development of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) that pre-train vast parameters and achieve remarkable zero-shot forecasting performance. Surprisingly, even after fine-tuning, TSFMs cannot consistently outperform smaller, specialized models trained on full-shot downstream data. A key question is how to realize effective adaptation of TSFMs for a target forecasting task. Through empirical studies on various TSFMs, the pre-trained models often exhibit inherent sparsity and redundancy in computation, suggesting that TSFMs have learned to activate task-relevant network substructures to accommodate diverse forecasting tasks. To preserve this valuable prior knowledge, we propose a structured pruning method to regularize the subsequent fine-tuning process by focusing it on a more relevant and compact parameter space. Extensive experiments on seven TSFMs and six benchmarks demonstrate that fine-tuning a smaller, pruned TSFM significantly improves forecasting performance compared to fine-tuning original models. This "prune-then-finetune" paradigm often enables TSFMs to achieve state-of-the-art performance and surpass strong specialized baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript with fixed typos and figures</p></details> |
| **[MADCluster: Model-agnostic Anomaly Detection with Self-supervised Clustering Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16223v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose MADCluster, a novel model-agnostic anomaly detection framework utilizing self-supervised clustering. MADCluster is applicable to various deep learning architectures and addresses the 'hypersphere collapse' problem inherent in existing deep learning-based anomaly detection methods. The core idea is to cluster normal pattern data into a 'single cluster' while simultaneously learning the cluster center and mapping data close to this center. Also, to improve expressiveness and enable effective single clustering, we propose a new 'One-directed Adaptive loss'. The optimization of this loss is mathematically proven. MADCluster consists of three main components: Base Embedder capturing high-dimensional temporal dynamics, Cluster Distance Mapping, and Sequence-wise Clustering for continuous center updates. Its model-agnostic characteristics are achieved by applying various architectures to the Base Embedder. Experiments on four time series benchmark datasets demonstrate that applying MADCluster improves the overall performance of comparative models. In conclusion, the compatibility of MADCluster shows potential for enhancing model performance across various architectures.</p></details> | 24 pages, 9 figures |
| **[FreRA: A Frequency-Refined Augmentation for Contrastive Learning on Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23181v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive learning has emerged as a competent approach for unsupervised representation learning. However, the design of an optimal augmentation strategy, although crucial for contrastive learning, is less explored for time series classification tasks. Existing predefined time-domain augmentation methods are primarily adopted from vision and are not specific to time series data. Consequently, this cross-modality incompatibility may distort the semantically relevant information of time series by introducing mismatched patterns into the data. To address this limitation, we present a novel perspective from the frequency domain and identify three advantages for downstream classification: global, independent, and compact. To fully utilize the three properties, we propose the lightweight yet effective Frequency Refined Augmentation (FreRA) tailored for time series contrastive learning on classification tasks, which can be seamlessly integrated with contrastive learning frameworks in a plug-and-play manner. Specifically, FreRA automatically separates critical and unimportant frequency components. Accordingly, we propose semantic-aware Identity Modification and semantic-agnostic Self-adaptive Modification to protect semantically relevant information in the critical frequency components and infuse variance into the unimportant ones respectively. Theoretically, we prove that FreRA generates semantic-preserving views. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, including UCR and UEA archives, as well as five large-scale datasets on diverse applications. FreRA consistently outperforms ten leading baselines on time series classification, anomaly detection, and transfer learning tasks, demonstrating superior capabilities in contrastive representation learning and generalization in transfer learning scenarios across diverse datasets.</p></details> | KDD 2025 |

The process begins with a denoising autoencoder to filter out random noise fluctuations from the main contract price data. Then, one-dimensional convolution reduces the dimensionality of the filtered data and extracts key information. The filtered and dimensionality-reduced price data is fed into a GANs network, and its output serve as input of a fully connected network. Through cross-validation, a model is trained to capture features that precede large price fluctuations. The model predicts the likelihood and direction of significant price changes in real-time price sequences, placing trades at moments of high prediction accuracy. Empirical results demonstrate that using autoencoders and convolution to filter and denoise financial data, combined with GANs, achieves a certain level of predictive performance, validating the capabilities of machine learning algorithms to discover underlying patterns in financial sequences.

| **[CrossLinear: Plug-and-Play Cross-Correlation Embedding for Time Series Forecasting with Exogenous Variables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23116v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting with exogenous variables is a critical emerging paradigm that presents unique challenges in modeling dependencies between variables. Traditional models often struggle to differentiate between endogenous and exogenous variables, leading to inefficiencies and overfitting. In this paper, we introduce CrossLinear, a novel Linear-based forecasting model that addresses these challenges by incorporating a plug-and-play cross-correlation embedding module. This lightweight module captures the dependencies between variables with minimal computational cost and seamlessly integrates into existing neural networks. Specifically, it captures time-invariant and direct variable dependencies while disregarding time-varying or indirect dependencies, thereby mitigating the risk of overfitting in dependency modeling and contributing to consistent performance improvements. Furthermore, CrossLinear employs patch-wise processing and a global linear head to effectively capture both short-term and long-term temporal dependencies, further improving its forecasting precision. Extensive experiments on 12 real-world datasets demonstrate that CrossLinear achieves superior performance in both short-term and long-term forecasting tasks. The ablation study underscores the effectiveness of the cross-correlation embedding module. Additionally, the generalizability of this module makes it a valuable plug-in for various forecasting tasks across different domains.

However, leveraging such abilities to model highly stochastic time series data remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel Stochastic Diffusion (StochDiff) model which learns data-driven prior knowledge at each time step by utilizing the representational power of the stochastic latent spaces to model the variability of the multivariate time series data. The learnt prior knowledge helps the model to capture complex temporal dynamics and the inherent uncertainty of the data. This improves its ability to model highly stochastic time series data. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model on stochastic time series forecasting. Additionally, we showcase an application of our model for real-world surgical guidance, highlighting its potential to benefit the medical community.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 figures.

The framework processes time-series financial data and evaluates performance using seven models: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), vanilla LSTM, XGBoost, LightGBM, and standard Neural Networks (NNs). Key metrics, including MAE, R-squared, MSE, and RMSE, are used to establish benchmarks across different time scales. Building on these benchmarks, we develop an ensemble model that combines the strengths of sequential and tree-based approaches. Experimental results show that the proposed framework improves accuracy by 10 to 15 percent compared to individual models and reduces error during market changes. This study highlights the potential of ensemble methods for financial forecasting and provides a flexible design for integrating new machine learning techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper have been accepted by IEEE confulence</p></details> |

Most existing methods excell at short-term forecasting, while overlooking the hurdles of Long-term Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting (LPTSF). As the forecast horizon extends, the inherent nonlinear dynamics have a significant adverse effect on prediction accuracy, and make generative models inefficient by increasing the cost of each iteration. To overcome these limitations, we introduce $K^2$VAE, an efficient VAE-based generative model that leverages a KoopmanNet to transform nonlinear time series into a linear dynamical system, and devises a KalmanNet to refine predictions and model uncertainty in such linear system, which reduces error accumulation in long-term forecasting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $K^2$VAE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both short- and long-term PTSF, providing a more efficient and accurate solution.</p></details> |  |

The model is designed for human activity recognition (HAR) using one-dimensional sensor signals and incorporates a tokenizer to extract patch-level representations. To train the model efficiently, we propose a knowledge distillation framework that transfers knowledge from a high-capacity MLP-Mixer teacher to the lightweight reservoir-based student model. Experimental evaluations on multiple HAR datasets demonstrate that our model achieves over 80 percent accuracy while significantly reducing computational cost. Notably, PatchEchoClassifier requires only about one-sixth of the floating point operations (FLOPS) compared to DeepConvLSTM, a widely used convolutional baseline. These results suggest that PatchEchoClassifier is a promising solution for real-time and energy-efficient human activity recognition in edge computing environments.</p></details> | 23 pages,5 figures |

These developments are necessitated by the increased volatility and scale in energy production for modern and future grids. However, progress in ML for OPF is hindered by the lack of standardized datasets and evaluation metrics, from generating and solving OPF instances, to training and benchmarking machine learning models. To address this challenge, this paper introduces PGLearn, a comprehensive suite of standardized datasets and evaluation tools for ML and OPF. PGLearn provides datasets that are representative of real-life operating conditions, by explicitly capturing both global and local variability in the data generation, and by, for the first time, including time series data for several large-scale systems. In addition, it supports multiple OPF formulations, including AC, DC, and second-order cone formulations. Standardized datasets are made publicly available to democratize access to this field, reduce the burden of data generation, and enable the fair comparison of various methodologies. PGLearn also includes a robust toolkit for training, evaluating, and benchmarking machine learning models for OPF, with the goal of standardizing performance evaluation across the field. By promoting open, standardized datasets and evaluation metrics, PGLearn aims at democratizing and accelerating research and innovation in machine learning applications for optimal power flow problems.

Existing methods struggle to capture reliable temporal patterns from such data due to significant missing values. While pre-trained foundation models show potential for addressing these challenges, they are typically designed for Regularly Sampled Time Series (RTS). Motivated by the visual Mask AutoEncoder's (MAE) powerful capability for modeling sparse multi-channel information and its success in RTS forecasting, we propose VIMTS, a framework adapting Visual MAE for IMTS forecasting. To mitigate the effect of missing values, VIMTS first processes IMTS along the timeline into feature patches at equal intervals. These patches are then complemented using learned cross-channel dependencies. Then it leverages visual MAE's capability in handling sparse multichannel data for patch reconstruction, followed by a coarse-to-fine technique to generate precise predictions from focused contexts. In addition, we integrate self-supervised learning for improved IMTS modeling by adapting the visual MAE to IMTS data.

In this work, we propose DRAGON (Discrete Representation and Augmented Graph encoding Over deBruijN Graphs), a novel encoder that introduces Multivariate de Bruijn Graphs (MdBGs) to bridge the gap between symbolic representations and neural modeling. DRAGON discretizes continuous input sequences and maps them onto a fixed graph structure, enabling dynamic context recovery via graph-based attention. Integrated as an auxiliary module within a dual-branch architecture, DRAGON augments conventional CNN-based encoders with symbolic, structure-aware representations.

| **[Intrinsic User-Centric Interpretability through Global Mixture of Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02933v4)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In human-centric settings like education or healthcare, model accuracy and model explainability are key factors for user adoption. Towards these two goals, intrinsically interpretable deep learning models have gained popularity, focusing on accurate predictions alongside faithful explanations. However, there exists a gap in the human-centeredness of these approaches, which often produce nuanced and complex explanations that are not easily actionable for downstream users. We present InterpretCC (interpretable conditional computation), a family of intrinsically interpretable neural networks at a unique point in the design space that optimizes for ease of human understanding and explanation faithfulness, while maintaining comparable performance to state-of-the-art models. InterpretCC achieves this through adaptive sparse activation of features before prediction, allowing the model to use a different, minimal set of features for each instance. We extend this idea into an interpretable, global mixture-of-experts (MoE) model that allows users to specify topics of interest, discretely separates the feature space for each data point into topical subnetworks, and adaptively and sparsely activates these topical subnetworks for prediction. We apply InterpretCC for text, time series and tabular data across several real-world datasets, demonstrating comparable performance with non-interpretable baselines and outperforming intrinsically interpretable baselines. Through a user study involving 56 teachers, InterpretCC explanations are found to have higher actionability and usefulness over other intrinsically interpretable approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a full paper at ICLR 2025 (top 5% of scores) in Singapore</p></details> |
| **[Forecasting Multivariate Urban Data via Decomposition and Spatio-Temporal Graph Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22474v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The forecasting of multivariate urban data presents a complex challenge due to the intricate dependencies between various urban metrics such as weather, air pollution, carbon intensity, and energy demand. This paper introduces a novel multivariate time-series forecasting model that utilizes advanced Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to capture spatial dependencies among different time-series variables. The proposed model incorporates a decomposition-based preprocessing step, isolating trend, seasonal, and residual components to enhance the accuracy and interpretability of forecasts. By leveraging the dynamic capabilities of GNNs, the model effectively captures interdependencies and improves the forecasting performance. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets, including electricity usage, weather metrics, carbon intensity, and air pollution data, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach across various forecasting scenarios. The results highlight the potential of the model to optimize smart infrastructure systems, contributing to energy-efficient urban development and enhanced public well-being.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches that rely on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods can capture the spatiotemporal dynamics of odor plumes, but are impractical for large-scale simulations due to their computational expense. On the other hand, puff-based simulations, although computationally tractable for large scales and capable of capturing the stochastic nature of plumes, fail to reproduce naturalistic odor statistics. Here, we present COSMOS (Configurable Odor Simulation Model over Scalable Spaces), a data-driven probabilistic framework that synthesizes realistic odor time series from spatial and temporal features of real datasets. COSMOS generates similar distributions of key statistical features such as whiff frequency, duration, and concentration as observed in real data, while dramatically reducing computational overhead. By reproducing critical statistical properties across a variety of flow regimes and scales, COSMOS enables the development and evaluation of agent-based navigation strategies with naturalistic odor experiences. To demonstrate its utility, we compare odor-tracking agents exposed to CFD-generated plumes versus COSMOS simulations, showing that both their odor experiences and resulting behaviors are quite similar.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 4 primary figures</p></details> |

Rates of convergence are also analyzed based on feasible sequences $\{k_{n}\}$. We work in three dependence settings: independence, Dedecker and Prieur's (2004) $\tau $-mixing and Wu's (2005) physical dependence. We initially ignore cross-coordinate $i$ dependence as a benchmark. We then work with martingale, nearly martingale, and mixing coordinates to deliver improved bounds on $k_{n}$. Finally, we use the results in three applications, each representing a key novelty: we ($i$) bound $k_{n}$\ for a max-correlation statistic for regression residuals under $\alpha $-mixing or physical dependence; ($ii$) extend correlation screening, or marginal regressions, to physical dependent data with diverging dimension $k_{n}$ $\rightarrow $ $\infty $; and ($iii$) test a high dimensional parameter after partialling out a fixed dimensional nuisance parameter in a linear time series regression model under $\tau $% -mixing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Infinite-dimensional Mahalanobis Distance with Applications to Kernelized Novelty Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11873v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Mahalanobis distance is a classical tool used to measure the covariance-adjusted distance between points in $\bbR^d$. In this work, we extend the concept of Mahalanobis distance to separable Banach spaces by reinterpreting it as a Cameron-Martin norm associated with a probability measure. This approach leads to a basis-free, data-driven notion of anomaly distance through the so-called variance norm, which can naturally be estimated using empirical measures of a sample. Our framework generalizes the classical $\bbR^d$, functional $(L^2[0,1])^d$, and kernelized settings; importantly, it incorporates non-injective covariance operators. We prove that the variance norm is invariant under invertible bounded linear transformations of the data, extending previous results which are limited to unitary operators. In the Hilbert space setting, we connect the variance norm to the RKHS of the covariance operator and establish consistency and convergence results for estimation using empirical measures. Using the variance norm, we introduce the notion of a kernelized nearest-neighbour Mahalanobis distance. In an empirical study on 12 real-world data sets, we demonstrate that the kernelized nearest-neighbour Mahalanobis distance outperforms the traditional kernelized Mahalanobis distance for multivariate time series novelty detection, using state-of-the-art time series kernels such as the signature, global alignment, and Volterra reservoir kernels.</p></details> |  |
| **[UDuo: Universal Dual Optimization Framework for Online Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22243v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online resource allocation under budget constraints critically depends on proper modeling of user arrival dynamics. Classical approaches employ stochastic user arrival models to derive near-optimal solutions through fractional matching formulations of exposed users for downstream allocation tasks. However, this is no longer a reasonable assumption when the environment changes dynamically. In this work, We propose the Universal Dual optimization framework UDuo, a novel paradigm that fundamentally rethinks online allocation through three key innovations: (i) a temporal user arrival representation vector that explicitly captures distribution shifts in user arrival patterns and resource consumption dynamics, (ii) a resource pacing learner with adaptive allocation policies that generalize to heterogeneous constraint scenarios, and (iii) an online time-series forecasting approach for future user arrival distributions that achieves asymptotically optimal solutions with constraint feasibility guarantees in dynamic environments. Experimental results show that UDuo achieves higher efficiency and faster convergence than the traditional stochastic arrival model in real-world pricing while maintaining rigorous theoretical validity for general online allocation problems.</p></details> |  |

These inputs are useful for diverse remote sensing tasks, such as crop mapping and flood detection. However, learning shared representations of remote sensing data is challenging, given the diversity of relevant data modalities, and because objects of interest vary massively in scale, from small boats (1-2 pixels and transient) to glaciers (thousands of pixels and persistent). We present a novel self-supervised learning algorithm that extracts multi-scale features across a flexible set of input modalities through masked modeling. Our dual global and local contrastive losses differ in their targets (deep representations vs. shallow input projections) and masking strategies (structured vs. not). Our Galileo is a single generalist model that outperforms SoTA specialist models for satellite images and pixel time series across eleven benchmarks and multiple tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgriFM: A Multi-source Temporal Remote Sensing Foundation Model for Crop Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21357v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate crop mapping fundamentally relies on modeling multi-scale spatiotemporal patterns, where spatial scales range from individual field textures to landscape-level context, and temporal scales capture both short-term phenological transitions and full growing-season dynamics. Transformer-based remote sensing foundation models (RSFMs) offer promising potential for crop mapping due to their innate ability for unified spatiotemporal processing. However, current RSFMs remain suboptimal for crop mapping: they either employ fixed spatiotemporal windows that ignore the multi-scale nature of crop systems or completely disregard temporal information by focusing solely on spatial patterns. To bridge these gaps, we present AgriFM, a multi-source remote sensing foundation model specifically designed for agricultural crop mapping. Our approach begins by establishing the necessity of simultaneous hierarchical spatiotemporal feature extraction, leading to the development of a modified Video Swin Transformer architecture where temporal down-sampling is synchronized with spatial scaling operations. This modified backbone enables efficient unified processing of long time-series satellite inputs. AgriFM leverages temporally rich data streams from three satellite sources including MODIS, Landsat-8/9 and Sentinel-2, and is pre-trained on a global representative dataset comprising over 25 million image samples supervised by land cover products. The resulting framework incorporates a versatile decoder architecture that dynamically fuses these learned spatiotemporal representations, supporting diverse downstream tasks. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate AgriFM's superior performance over conventional deep learning approaches and state-of-the-art general-purpose RSFMs across all downstream tasks. Codes will be available at https://github.com/flyakon/AgriFM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Forecasting of Sparse Intraoperative Hypotension Events Powered by Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22116v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) frequently occurs under general anesthesia and is strongly linked to adverse outcomes such as myocardial injury and increased mortality. Despite its significance, IOH prediction is hindered by event sparsity and the challenge of integrating static and dynamic data across diverse patients. In this paper, we propose \textbf{IOHFuseLM}, a multimodal language model framework. To accurately identify and differentiate sparse hypotensive events, we leverage a two-stage training strategy. The first stage involves domain adaptive pretraining on IOH physiological time series augmented through diffusion methods, thereby enhancing the model sensitivity to patterns associated with hypotension. Subsequently, task fine-tuning is performed on the original clinical dataset to further enhance the ability to distinguish normotensive from hypotensive states. To enable multimodal fusion for each patient, we align structured clinical descriptions with the corresponding physiological time series at the token level. Such alignment enables the model to capture individualized temporal patterns alongside their corresponding clinical semantics. In addition, we convert static patient attributes into structured text to enrich personalized information. Experimental evaluations on two intraoperative datasets demonstrate that IOHFuseLM outperforms established baselines in accurately identifying IOH events, highlighting its applicability in clinical decision support scenarios. Our code is publicly available to promote reproducibility at https://github.com/zjt-gpu/IOHFuseLM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conditional Denoising Meets Polynomial Modeling: A Flexible Decoupled Framework for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13253v6)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting models are becoming increasingly prevalent due to their critical role in decision-making across various domains. However, most existing approaches represent the coupled temporal patterns, often neglecting the distinction between their specific components. In particular, fluctuating patterns and smooth trends within time series exhibit distinct characteristics. In this work, to model complicated temporal patterns, we propose a Conditional Denoising Polynomial Modeling (CDPM) framework, where probabilistic diffusion models and deterministic linear models are trained end-to-end. Instead of modeling the coupled time series, CDPM decomposes it into trend and seasonal components for modeling them separately. To capture the fluctuating seasonal component, we employ a probabilistic diffusion model based on statistical properties from the historical window. For the smooth trend component, a module is proposed to enhance linear models by incorporating historical dependencies, thereby preserving underlying trends and mitigating noise distortion. Extensive experiments conducted on six benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, highlighting the potential of combining probabilistic and deterministic models.Our code is available at https://github.com/zjt-gpu/CDPM.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hybrid Multi-Factor Network with Dynamic Sequence Modeling for Early Warning of Intraoperative Hypotension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11064v3)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) prediction using past physiological signals is crucial, as IOH may lead to inadequate organ perfusion and significantly elevate the risk of severe complications and mortality. However, current methods often rely on static modeling, overlooking the complex temporal dependencies and the inherently non-stationary nature of physiological signals. We propose a Hybrid Multi-Factor (HMF) network that formulates IOH prediction as a dynamic sequence forecasting task, explicitly capturing both temporal dependencies and physiological non-stationarity. We represent signal dynamics as multivariate time series and decompose them into trend and seasonal components, enabling separate modeling of long-term and periodic variations. Each component is encoded with a patch-based Transformer to balance computational efficiency and feature representation. To address distributional drift from evolving signals, we introduce a symmetric normalization mechanism. Experiments on both public and real-world clinical datasets show that HMF significantly outperforms competitive baselines. We hope HMF offers new insights into IOH prediction and ultimately promotes safer surgical care. Our code is available at https://github.com/Mingyue-Cheng/HMF.</p></details> |  |

We target a change in distribution that occurs in a small, unknown subset of dimensions, where these dimensions may be correlated. Our work is motivated by a remote sensing application, where changes occur in small, spatially clustered regions over time. An adaptive block-based change-point detection framework is proposed that accounts for spatial dependencies across dimensions and leverages these dependencies to boost detection power and improve estimation accuracy. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that our approach has superior performance in detecting sparse changes in datasets with spatial or local group structures. An application of the proposed method to detect activity, such as new construction, in remote sensing imagery of the Natanz Nuclear facility in Iran is presented to demonstrate the method's efficacy.</p></details> |  |

Such management is enabled by RICs, which facilitate near-real-time and non-real-time network control through xApps and rApps. However, they face limitations, including latency overhead in data exchange between the RAN and RIC, restricting real-time monitoring, and the inability to access user plain data due to privacy and security constraints, hindering use cases like beamforming and spectrum classification. In this paper, we leverage the dApps concept to enable real-time RF spectrum classification with LibIQ, a novel library for RF signals that facilitates efficient spectrum monitoring and signal classification by providing functionalities to read I/Q samples as time-series, create datasets and visualize time-series data through plots and spectrograms. Thanks to LibIQ, I/Q samples can be efficiently processed to detect external RF signals, which are subsequently classified using a CNN inside the library. To achieve accurate spectrum analysis, we created an extensive dataset of time-series-based I/Q samples, representing distinct signal types captured using a custom dApp running on a 5G deployment over the Colosseum network emulator and an OTA testbed. We evaluate our model by deploying LibIQ in heterogeneous scenarios with varying center frequencies, time windows, and external RF signals. In real-time analysis, the model classifies the processed I/Q samples, achieving an average accuracy of approximately 97.8% in identifying signal types across all scenarios. We pledge to release both LibIQ and the dataset created as a publicly available framework upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Explainable Multi-modal Time Series Prediction with LLM-in-the-Loop](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01013v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis provides essential insights for real-world system dynamics and informs downstream decision-making, yet most existing methods often overlook the rich contextual signals present in auxiliary modalities. To bridge this gap, we introduce TimeXL, a multi-modal prediction framework that integrates a prototype-based time series encoder with three collaborating Large Language Models (LLMs) to deliver more accurate predictions and interpretable explanations. First, a multi-modal prototype-based encoder processes both time series and textual inputs to generate preliminary forecasts alongside case-based rationales. These outputs then feed into a prediction LLM, which refines the forecasts by reasoning over the encoder's predictions and explanations. Next, a reflection LLM compares the predicted values against the ground truth, identifying textual inconsistencies or noise. Guided by this feedback, a refinement LLM iteratively enhances text quality and triggers encoder retraining. This closed-loop workflow -- prediction, critique (reflect), and refinement -- continuously boosts the framework's performance and interpretability. Empirical evaluations on four real-world datasets demonstrate that TimeXL achieves up to 8.9\% improvement in AUC and produces human-centric, multi-modal explanations, highlighting the power of LLM-driven reasoning for time series prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[TS-RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation based Time Series Foundation Models are Stronger Zero-Shot Forecaster](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07649v3)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) and Foundation Models (FMs) have recently become prevalent for time series forecasting tasks. While fine-tuning LLMs enables domain adaptation, they often struggle to generalize across diverse and unseen datasets. Moreover, existing Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) still face challenges in handling non-stationary dynamics and distribution shifts, largely due to the lack of effective mechanisms for adaptation. To this end, we present TS-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework for time series forecasting that enhances the generalization and interpretability of TSFMs. Specifically, TS-RAG leverages pre-trained time series encoders to retrieve semantically relevant segments from a dedicated knowledge base, enriching the contextual representation of the input query. Furthermore, we propose an Adaptive Retrieval Mixer (ARM) module that dynamically fuses the retrieved patterns with the TSFM's internal representation, improving forecasting accuracy without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Thorough empirical studies on seven public benchmark datasets demonstrate that TS-RAG achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot forecasting performance, outperforming the existing TSFMs by up to 6.84% across diverse domains while also providing desirable interpretability.</p></details> |  |

Discrete token-based approaches are limited in numeric representation capacity while methods like neural ordinary differential equations are not well suited for categorical data or informative sampling and require augmentation to handle certain classes of trajectories. Here, we present multivariateGPT, a single architecture for modeling sequences of mixed categorical (including tokenized text) and numeric data. This is accomplished with an autoregressive sequence decomposition, embedding scheme, and loss function that extend the next token prediction task to likelihood estimation of the joint distribution of next token class and value. We demonstrate how this approach can efficiently learn to generalize patterns in simple physical systems and model complex time series including electrocardiograms and multivariate electronic health record data. This work extends the utility of transformer based models to additional classes of data.</p></details> | 15 pates, 5 figures |
| **[Learning optimal treatment strategies for intraoperative hypotension using deep reinforcement learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21596v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional methods of surgical decision making heavily rely on human experience and prompt actions, which are variable. A data-driven system generating treatment recommendations based on patient states can be a substantial asset in perioperative decision-making, as in cases of intraoperative hypotension, for which suboptimal management is associated with acute kidney injury (AKI), a common and morbid postoperative complication. We developed a Reinforcement Learning (RL) model to recommend optimum dose of intravenous (IV) fluid and vasopressors during surgery to avoid intraoperative hypotension and postoperative AKI. We retrospectively analyzed 50,021 surgeries from 42,547 adult patients who underwent major surgery at a quaternary care hospital between June 2014 and September 2020. Of these, 34,186 surgeries were used for model training and 15,835 surgeries were reserved for testing. We developed a Deep Q-Networks based RL model using 16 variables including intraoperative physiologic time series, total dose of IV fluid and vasopressors extracted for every 15-minute epoch. The model replicated 69% of physician's decisions for the dosage of vasopressors and proposed higher or lower dosage of vasopressors than received in 10% and 21% of the treatments, respectively. In terms of IV fluids, the model's recommendations were within 0.05 ml/kg/15 min of the actual dose in 41% of the cases, with higher or lower doses recommended for 27% and 32% of the treatments, respectively. The model resulted in a higher estimated policy value compared to the physicians' actual treatments, as well as random and zero-drug policies. AKI prevalence was the lowest in patients receiving medication dosages that aligned with model's decisions. Our findings suggest that implementation of the model's policy has the potential to reduce postoperative AKI and improve other outcomes driven by intraoperative hypotension.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 1 table, 5 figures, 5 supplemental tables, 6 supplemental figures</p></details> |
| **[FRIREN: Beyond Trajectories -- A Spectral Lens on Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17370v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term time-series forecasting (LTSF) models are often presented as general-purpose solutions that can be applied across domains, implicitly assuming that all data is pointwise predictable. Using chaotic systems such as Lorenz-63 as a case study, we argue that geometric structure - not pointwise prediction - is the right abstraction for a dynamic-agnostic foundational model. Minimizing the Wasserstein-2 distance (W2), which captures geometric changes, and providing a spectral view of dynamics are essential for long-horizon forecasting. Our model, FRIREN (Flow-inspired Representations via Interpretable Eigen-networks), implements an augmented normalizing-flow block that embeds data into a normally distributed latent representation. It then generates a W2-efficient optimal path that can be decomposed into rotation, scaling, inverse rotation, and translation. This architecture yields locally generated, geometry-preserving predictions that are independent of the underlying dynamics, and a global spectral representation that functions as a finite Koopman operator with a small modification. This enables practitioners to identify which modes grow, decay, or oscillate, both locally and system-wide. FRIREN achieves an MSE of 11.4, MAE of 1.6, and SWD of 0.96 on Lorenz-63 in a 336-in, 336-out, dt=0.01 setting, surpassing TimeMixer (MSE 27.3, MAE 2.8, SWD 2.1). The model maintains effective prediction for 274 out of 336 steps, approximately 2.5 Lyapunov times. On Rossler (96-in, 336-out), FRIREN achieves an MSE of 0.0349, MAE of 0.0953, and SWD of 0.0170, outperforming TimeMixer's MSE of 4.3988, MAE of 0.886, and SWD of 3.2065. FRIREN is also competitive on standard LTSF datasets such as ETT and Weather. By connecting modern generative flows with classical spectral analysis, FRIREN makes long-term forecasting both accurate and interpretable, setting a new benchmark for LTSF model design.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 4 figures.

Current mechanistic models often struggle to accurately forecast outcomes for patients with irregular or atypical trajectories. In this study, we develop and compare hybrid mechanistic and data-driven approaches for individualized time series modeling of platelet counts during chemotherapy. We consider hybrid models that combine mechanistic models with neural networks, known as universal differential equations. As a purely data-driven alternative, we utilize a nonlinear autoregressive exogenous model using gated recurrent units as the underlying architecture. These models are evaluated across a range of real patient scenarios, varying in data availability and sparsity, to assess predictive performance. Our findings demonstrate that data-driven methods, when provided with sufficient data, significantly improve prediction accuracy, particularly for high-risk patients with irregular platelet dynamics. This highlights the potential of data-driven approaches in enhancing clinical decision-making. In contrast, hybrid and mechanistic models are superior in scenarios with limited or sparse data. The proposed modeling and comparison framework is generalizable and could be extended to predict other treatment-related toxicities, offering broad applicability in personalized medicine.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose Implicit Dynamical Flow Fusion (IDFF); IDFF learns a new vector field with an additional momentum term that enables taking longer steps during sample generation while maintaining the fidelity of the generated distribution. Consequently, IDFFs reduce the NFEs by a factor of ten (relative to CFMs) without sacrificing sample quality, enabling rapid sampling and efficient handling of image and time-series data generation tasks. We evaluate IDFF on standard benchmarks such as CIFAR-10 and CelebA for image generation, where we achieve likelihood and quality performance comparable to CFMs and diffusion-based models with fewer NFEs. IDFF also shows superior performance on time-series datasets modeling, including molecular simulation and sea surface temperature (SST) datasets, highlighting its versatility and effectiveness across different domains.\href{https://github.com/MrRezaeiUofT/IDFF}{Github Repository}</p></details> |  |

Efforts involving green revolution, land irrigations, improved seeds and organic farming have yielded suboptimal outcomes. The adoption of computational tools like crop recommendation systems offers a new way to provide insights and help farmers tackle low productivity. However, most agricultural recommendation systems in India focus narrowly on environmental factors and regions, limiting accurate predictions of high-yield, profitable crops. This study uses environmental and economic factors with 19 crops across 15 states to develop and evaluate Random Forest and SVM models using 10-fold Cross Validation, Time-series Split, and Lag Variables. The 10-fold cross validation showed high accuracy (RF: 99.96%, SVM: 94.71%) but raised overfitting concerns. Introducing temporal order, better reflecting real-world conditions, reduced performance (RF: 78.55%, SVM: 71.18%) in the Time-series Split.To further increase the model accuracy while maintaining the temporal order, the Lag Variables approach was employed, which resulted in improved performance (RF: 83.62%, SVM: 74.38%) compared to the 10-fold cross validation approach. Overall, the models in the Time-series Split and Lag Variable Approaches offer practical insights by handling temporal dependencies and enhancing its adaptability to changing agricultural conditions over time. Consequently, the study shows the Random Forest model developed based on the Lag Variables as the most preferred algorithm for optimal crop recommendation in the Indian context.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages and 13 figures</p></details> |

Using 10 diverse datasets, randomness injection, and 13 configurable data transformations, STEB computes indicators for measure reliability and score consistency. It tracks running time, test errors, and features sequential and parallel modes of operation. In our experiments, we determine a ranking of 41 measures from literature and confirm that the choice of upstream time series embedding heavily impacts the final score.</p></details> |  |

Our model, Online HiPPO Sparse Variational Gaussian Process (OHSVGP), leverages the HiPPO (High-order Polynomial Projection Operators) framework, which is popularized in the RNN domain due to its long-range memory modeling capabilities. We interpret the HiPPO time-varying orthogonal projections as inducing variables with time-dependent orthogonal polynomial basis functions, which allows the SVGP inducing variables to memorize the process history. We show that the HiPPO framework fits naturally into the interdomain GP framework and demonstrate that the kernel matrices can also be updated online in a recurrence form based on the ODE evolution of HiPPO. We evaluate OHSVGP with online prediction for 1D time series, continual learning in discriminative GP model for data with multidimensional inputs, and deep generative modeling with sparse Gaussian process variational autoencoder, showing that it outperforms existing online GP methods in terms of predictive performance, long-term memory preservation, and computational efficiency.</p></details> | 27 pages, 17 figures |

Introducing causality into the modelling process offers a promising way to mitigate these challenges by enhancing predictive robustness. However, constructing an initial causal graph manually using domain knowledge is time-consuming, particularly in complex time series with numerous variables. To address this, causal discovery algorithms can provide a preliminary causal structure that domain experts can refine. This study investigates causal feature selection with domain knowledge using a data center system as an example. We use simulated time-series data to compare different causal feature selection with traditional machine-learning feature selection methods. Our results show that predictions based on causal features are more robust compared to those derived from traditional methods. These findings underscore the potential of combining causal discovery algorithms with human expertise to improve machine learning applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures and 3 tables</p></details> |

One of the major techniques to victimize users is luring them by black-hat search-engine-optimization (SEO); making search engines display their lure pages as if these were placed on compromised websites and then redirecting visitors to malicious sites. In this study, we focus on the threat actors conduct fake E-commerce scam with this strategy. Our previous study looked at the connection between some malware families used for black-hat SEO to enlighten threat actors and their infrastructures, however it shows only a limited part of the whole picture because we could not find all SEO malware samples from limited sources. In this paper, we aim to identify and analyze threat actor groups using a large dataset of fake E-commerce sites collected by Japan Cybercrime Control Center, which we believe is of higher quality. It includes 692,865 fake EC sites gathered from redirectors over two and a half years, from May 20, 2022 to Dec. 31, 2024. We analyzed the links between these sites using Maltego, a well-known link analysis tool, and tailored programs. We also conducted time series analysis to track group changes in the groups. According to the analysis, we estimate that 17 relatively large groups were active during the dataset period and some of them were active throughout the period.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, the shaprpy Python library brings the core capabilities of shapr to the Python ecosystem. Shapley values originate from cooperative game theory in the 1950s, but have over the past few years become a widely used method for quantifying how a model's features/covariates contribute to specific prediction outcomes. The shapr package emphasizes conditional Shapley value estimates, providing a comprehensive range of approaches for accurately capturing feature dependencies -- a crucial aspect for correct model explanation, typically lacking in similar software. In addition to regular tabular data, the shapr R package includes specialized functionality for explaining time series forecasts. The package offers a minimal set of user functions with sensible default values for most use cases while providing extensive flexibility for advanced users to fine-tune computations. Additional features include parallelized computations, iterative estimation with convergence detection, and rich visualization tools. shapr also extends its functionality to compute causal and asymmetric Shapley values when causal information is available. Overall, the shapr and shaprpy packages aim to enhance the interpretability of predictive models within a powerful and user-friendly framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Deep Learning Approach for Estimating the Metallicities of RR Lyrae Stars Using light curves from Gaia Data Release 3](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20947v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) are old pulsating variables widely used as metallicity tracers due to the correlation between their metal abundances and light curve morphology. With ESA Gaia DR3 providing light curves for about 270,000 RRLs, there is a pressing need for scalable methods to estimate their metallicities from photometric data. We introduce a unified deep learning framework that estimates metallicities for both fundamental-mode (RRab) and first-overtone (RRc) RRLs using Gaia G-band light curves. This approach extends our previous work on RRab stars to include RRc stars, aiming for high predictive accuracy and broad generalization across both pulsation types. The model is based on a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural network optimized for time-series extrinsic regression. Our pipeline includes preprocessing steps such as phase folding, smoothing, and sample weighting, and uses photometric metallicities from the literature as training targets. The architecture is designed to handle morphological differences between RRab and RRc light curves without requiring separate models. On held-out validation sets, our GRU model achieves strong performance: for RRab stars, MAE = 0.0565 dex, RMSE = 0.0765 dex, R^2 = 0.9401; for RRc stars, MAE = 0.0505 dex, RMSE = 0.0720 dex, R^2 = 0.9625. These results show the effectiveness of deep learning for large-scale photometric metallicity estimation and support its application to studies of stellar populations and Galactic structure.</p></details> |  |

Supervised machine learning and deep learning algorithms have long been used to extract meaningful activity information from raw accelerometry data, but progress has been hampered by the limited amount of labeled data that is publicly available. Exploiting large unlabeled datasets using self-supervised pretraining is a relatively new and underexplored approach in the field of human activity recognition (HAR). We used a time-series transformer masked autoencoder (MAE) approach to self-supervised pretraining and propose two novel spectrogram-based loss functions: the log-scale meanmagnitude (LMM) and log-scale magnitude variance (LMV) losses. We compared these losses with the mean squared error (MSE) loss for MAE training. We leveraged the large unlabeled UK Biobank accelerometry dataset (n = 109k) for pretraining and evaluated downstream HAR performance using a linear classifier in a smaller labelled dataset. We found that pretraining with the LMM loss improved performance compared to an MAE pretrained with the MSE loss, with 12.7% increase in subject-wise F1 score when using linear probing. Compared with a state-of-the-art ResNet-based HAR model, our LMM-pretrained transformer models performed better (+9.8% F1) with linear probing and comparably when fine-tuned using an LSTM classifier. The addition of the LMV to the LMM loss decreased performance compared to the LMM loss alone. These findings establish the LMM loss as a robust and effective method for pretraining MAE models on accelerometer data for HAR and show the potential of pretraining sequence-based models for free-living HAR.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, accepted in 47th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)</p></details> |

Deep learning models like the DeepConvLSTM typically classify each window independently, thereby restricting learnable temporal context to within-window information. To address this constraint, we propose DeepConvContext, a multi-scale time series classification framework for HAR. Drawing inspiration from the vision-based Temporal Action Localization community, DeepConvContext models both intra- and inter-window temporal patterns by processing sequences of time-ordered windows. Unlike recent HAR models that incorporate attention mechanisms, DeepConvContext relies solely on LSTMs -- with ablation studies demonstrating the superior performance of LSTMs over attention-based variants for modeling inertial sensor data. Across six widely-used HAR benchmarks, DeepConvContext achieves an average 10% improvement in F1-score over the classic DeepConvLSTM, with gains of up to 21%.

| **[Mixture of Low Rank Adaptation with Partial Parameter Sharing for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17872v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-task forecasting has become the standard approach for time-series forecasting (TSF). However, we show that it suffers from an Expressiveness Bottleneck, where predictions at different time steps share the same representation, leading to unavoidable errors even with optimal representations. To address this issue, we propose a two-stage framework: first, pre-train a foundation model for one-step-ahead prediction; then, adapt it using step-specific LoRA modules.This design enables the foundation model to handle any number of forecast steps while avoiding the expressiveness bottleneck. We further introduce the Mixture-of-LoRA (MoLA) model, which employs adaptively weighted LoRA experts to achieve partial parameter sharing across steps. This approach enhances both efficiency and forecasting performance by exploiting interdependencies between forecast steps. Experiments show that MoLA significantly improves model expressiveness and outperforms state-of-the-art time-series forecasting methods.

| **[TimePro: Efficient Multivariate Long-term Time Series Forecasting with Variable- and Time-Aware Hyper-state](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20774v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In long-term time series forecasting, different variables often influence the target variable over distinct time intervals, a challenge known as the multi-delay issue. Traditional models typically process all variables or time points uniformly, which limits their ability to capture complex variable relationships and obtain non-trivial time representations. To address this issue, we propose TimePro, an innovative Mamba-based model that constructs variate- and time-aware hyper-states. Unlike conventional approaches that merely transfer plain states across variable or time dimensions, TimePro preserves the fine-grained temporal features of each variate token and adaptively selects the focused time points to tune the plain state. The reconstructed hyper-state can perceive both variable relationships and salient temporal information, which helps the model make accurate forecasting. In experiments, TimePro performs competitively on eight real-world long-term forecasting benchmarks with satisfactory linear complexity.

| **[Robust and Explainable Detector of Time Series Anomaly via Augmenting Multiclass Pseudo-Anomalies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20765v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised anomaly detection in time series has been a pivotal research area for decades. Current mainstream approaches focus on learning normality, on the assumption that all or most of the samples in the training set are normal. However, anomalies in the training set (i.e., anomaly contamination) can be misleading. Recent studies employ data augmentation to generate pseudo-anomalies and learn the boundary separating the training samples from the augmented samples. Although this approach mitigates anomaly contamination if augmented samples mimic unseen real anomalies, it suffers from several limitations. (1) Covering a wide range of time series anomalies is challenging. (2) It disregards augmented samples that resemble normal samples (i.e., false anomalies). (3) It places too much trust in the labels of training and augmented samples. In response, we propose RedLamp, which employs diverse data augmentations to generate multiclass pseudo-anomalies and learns the multiclass boundary. Such multiclass pseudo-anomalies cover a wide variety of time series anomalies. We conduct multiclass classification using soft labels, which prevents the model from being overconfident and ensures its robustness against contaminated/false anomalies. The learned latent space is inherently explainable as it is trained to separate pseudo-anomalies into multiclasses. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RedLamp in anomaly detection and its robustness against anomaly contamination.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2025 |
| **[Enhanced Prediction Model for Time Series Characterized by GARCH via Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Inference System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01675v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>GARCH-type time series (characterized by Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) exhibit pronounced volatility, autocorrelation, and heteroskedasticity. To address these challenges and enhance predictive accuracy, this study introduces a hybrid forecasting framework that integrates the Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Inference System (IT2FIS) with the GARCH model. Leveraging the interval-based uncertainty representation of IT2FIS and the volatility-capturing capability of GARCH, the proposed model effectively mitigates the adverse impact of heteroskedasticity on prediction reliability. Specifically, the GARCH component estimates conditional variance, which is subsequently incorporated into the Gaussian membership functions of IT2FIS. This integration transforms IT2FIS into an adaptive variable-parameter system, dynamically aligning with the time-varying volatility of the target series. Through systematic parameter optimization, the framework not only captures intricate volatility patterns but also accounts for heteroskedasticity and epistemic uncertainties during modeling, thereby improving both prediction precision and model robustness. Experimental validation employs diverse datasets, including air quality concentration, urban traffic flow, and energy consumption. Comparative analyses are conducted against models: the GARCH-Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (GARCH-TSK) model, fixed-variance time series models, the GARCH-Gated Recurrent Unit (GARCH-GRU), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The results indicate that the proposed model achieves superior predictive performance across the majority of test scenarios in error metrics. These findings underscore the effectiveness of hybrid approaches in forecasting uncertainty for GARCH-type time series, highlighting their practical utility in real-world time series forecasting applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 13 figures, references added</p></details> |

Despite their architectural innovations, most state-of-the-art models report only marginal improvements -- typically just a few thousandths in standard error metrics. These models often incorporate complex data embedding layers to transform raw inputs into higher-dimensional representations to enhance accuracy. But are data embedding techniques actually effective in time series forecasting? Through extensive ablation studies across fifteen state-of-the-art models and four benchmark datasets, we find that removing data embedding layers from many state-of-the-art models does not degrade forecasting performance. In many cases, it improves both accuracy and computational efficiency. The gains from removing embedding layers often exceed the performance differences typically reported between competing models.

The method takes multi-dimensional performance metric sequences as input. We use a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to model the evolution of system states over time. An attention mechanism is then applied to enhance key temporal segments, improving the model's ability to identify potential faults. On this basis, a feedforward neural network is designed to perform the final classification, enabling early warning of system failures. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, comparative experiments and ablation analyses were conducted using data from a large-scale real-world cloud system. The experimental results show that the model outperforms various mainstream time-series models in terms of Accuracy, F1-Score, and AUC. This demonstrates strong prediction capability and stability. Furthermore, the loss function curve confirms the convergence and reliability of the training process. It indicates that the proposed method effectively learns system behavior patterns and achieves efficient fault detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating Hypotheses of Dynamic Causal Graphs in Neuroscience: Leveraging Generative Factor Models of Observed Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20697v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of hypothesis generation promises to reduce costs in neuroscience by narrowing the range of interventional studies needed to study various phenomena. Existing machine learning methods can generate scientific hypotheses from complex datasets, but many approaches assume causal relationships are static over time, limiting their applicability to systems with dynamic, state-dependent behavior, such as the brain. While some techniques attempt dynamic causal discovery through factor models, they often restrict relationships to linear patterns or impose other simplifying assumptions. We propose a novel method that models dynamic graphs as a conditionally weighted superposition of static graphs, where each static graph can capture nonlinear relationships. This approach enables the detection of complex, time-varying interactions between variables beyond linear limitations. Our method improves f1-scores of predicted dynamic causal patterns by roughly 22-28% on average over baselines in some of our experiments, with some improvements reaching well over 60%. A case study on real brain data demonstrates our method's ability to uncover relationships linked to specific behavioral states, offering valuable insights into neural dynamics.</p></details> |  |

Automated engagement measurement helps instructors monitor student participation, identify disengagement, and adapt their teaching strategies to enhance learning outcomes effectively. This paper identifies two key challenges in this problem: class imbalance and incorporating order into engagement levels rather than treating it as mere categories. Then, a novel approach to video-based student engagement measurement in virtual learning environments is proposed that utilizes supervised contrastive learning for ordinal classification of engagement. Various affective and behavioral features are extracted from video samples and utilized to train ordinal classifiers within a supervised contrastive learning framework (with a sequential classifier as the encoder). A key step involves the application of diverse time-series data augmentation techniques to these feature vectors, enhancing model training. The effectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated using a publicly available dataset for engagement measurement, DAiSEE, containing videos of students who participated in virtual learning programs. The results demonstrate the robust ability of the proposed method for the classification of the engagement level. This approach promises a significant contribution to understanding and enhancing student engagement in virtual learning environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 1 figure, 5 tables</p></details> |

Existing large-scale time series datasets often suffer from inherent biases and imbalanced distributions, leading to suboptimal model performance and generalization. To address this gap, we introduce BLAST, a novel pre-training corpus designed to enhance data diversity through a balanced sampling strategy. First, BLAST incorporates 321 billion observations from publicly available datasets and employs a comprehensive suite of statistical metrics to characterize time series patterns. Then, to facilitate pattern-oriented sampling, the data is implicitly clustered using grid-based partitioning. Furthermore, by integrating grid sampling and grid mixup techniques, BLAST ensures a balanced and representative coverage of diverse patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that models pre-trained on BLAST achieve state-of-the-art performance with a fraction of the computational resources and training tokens required by existing methods. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of data diversity in improving both training efficiency and model performance for the universal forecasting task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGKDD 2025 (Research Track)</p></details> |

Among them, the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model remains a widely adopted linear technique due to its effectiveness in modeling temporal dependencies in economic, industrial, and social data. On the other hand, polynomial classifi-ers offer a robust framework for capturing non-linear relationships and have demonstrated competitive performance in domains such as stock price pre-diction. In this study, we propose a hybrid forecasting approach that inte-grates the ARIMA model with a polynomial classifier to leverage the com-plementary strengths of both models. The hybrid method is evaluated on multiple real-world time series datasets spanning diverse domains. Perfor-mance is assessed based on forecasting accuracy and computational effi-ciency. Experimental results reveal that the proposed hybrid model consist-ently outperforms the individual models in terms of prediction accuracy, al-beit with a modest increase in execution time.</p></details> |  |

Recent researches demonstrate data-driven neural networks surpass traditional statistical methods, especially when the analytical form of signals is hard to obtain, or noise is significant. However, most densely connected or convolution-based networks fail to fully exploit the spectral and temporal structure of scintillation signals, leaving large space for performance improvement. In this paper, we propose a network architecture specially tailored for scintillation pulse characterization based on previous works on time series analysis. The core insight is that, by directly applying Fast Fourier Transform on original signals and utilizing different frequency components, the proposed network architecture can serve as a lightweight and enhanced representation learning backbone. We prove our idea in two case studies: (a) simulation data generated with the setting of the LUX dark matter detector, and (b) experimental electrical signals with fast electronics to emulate scintillation variations for the NICA/MPD calorimeter. The proposed model achieves significantly better results than the reference model in literature and densely connected models and demonstrates higher cost-efficiency than conventional machine learning methods.</p></details> | 30 pages, 14 figures |

Classical time series classification and deep learning techniques have demonstrated limited efficacy in monitoring PD symptoms using wearable accelerometer data due to complex PD movement patterns and the small size of available datasets. We investigate InceptionTime and RandOm Convolutional KErnel Transform (ROCKET) as they are promising for PD symptom monitoring. InceptionTime's high learning capacity is well-suited to modeling complex movement patterns, while ROCKET is suited to small datasets. With random search methodology, we identify the highest-scoring InceptionTime architecture and compare its performance to ROCKET with a ridge classifier and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) on wrist motion data from PD patients. Our findings indicate that all approaches can learn to estimate tremor severity and bradykinesia presence with moderate performance but encounter challenges in detecting dyskinesia. Among the presented approaches, ROCKET demonstrates higher scores in identifying dyskinesia, whereas InceptionTime exhibits slightly better performance in tremor and bradykinesia estimation. Notably, both methods outperform the multi-layer perceptron. In conclusion, InceptionTime can classify complex wrist motion time series and holds potential for continuous symptom monitoring in PD with further development.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The source code is available under https://github.com/cedricdonie/tsc-for-wrist-motion-pd-detection</p></details> |

We present the Rotary Masked Autoencoder (RoMAE), which utilizes the popular Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) method for continuous positions. RoMAE is an extension to the Masked Autoencoder (MAE) that enables representation learning with multidimensional continuous positional information while avoiding any time-series-specific architectural specializations. We showcase RoMAE's performance on a variety of modalities including irregular and multivariate time-series, images, and audio, demonstrating that RoMAE surpasses specialized time-series architectures on difficult datasets such as the DESC ELAsTiCC Challenge while maintaining MAE's usual performance across other modalities. In addition, we investigate RoMAE's ability to reconstruct the embedded continuous positions, demonstrating that including learned embeddings in the input sequence breaks RoPE's relative position property.</p></details> | 26 pages, 5 figures |

This "model-free" embedding has been successfully leveraged to build multiple domain-agnostic machine learning (ML) algorithms for time series and sequential data. The convergence results proved in this paper bridge the gap between the expected signature's empirical discrete-time estimator and its theoretical continuous-time value, allowing for a more complete probabilistic interpretation of expected signature-based ML methods. Moreover, when the data generating process is a martingale, we suggest a simple modification of the expected signature estimator with significantly lower mean squared error and empirically demonstrate how it can be effectively applied to improve predictive performance.</p></details> |  |

By incorporating the modeling flexibility of DGPs with the change-identification capabilities of spectral methods, our approach adapts to diverse spectral change behaviors and effectively localizes multiple change points. Experiments on both simulated and real-world data demonstrate that our method outperforms existing techniques in terms of detection accuracy and sampling efficiency for non-stationary time series.</p></details> |  |

We used data collected on a tabletop apparatus by mounting to the plate four piezoelectric transducers, each of which took turn to generate a Lamb wave that then traversed the region of interest before being received by the remaining three sensors. On training a neural network to analyze time-series data of the material response, which displayed damage-reflective features whenever the plate guided waves interacted with a contact load, we achieved a model that detected with greater than $99\%$ accuracy in addition to a model that localized with $2.58 \pm 0.12$ mm mean distance error. For each task, the best-performing model was designed according to the inductive bias that our transducers were both similar and arranged in a square pattern on a nearly uniform plate.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent advances in generative modeling, a comprehensive understanding of how state-of-the-art generative models perform under limited supervision remains lacking. In this work, we conduct the first large-scale study evaluating leading generative models in data-scarce settings, revealing a substantial performance gap between full-data and data-scarce regimes. To close this gap, we propose a unified diffusion-based generative framework that can synthesize high-fidelity time series across diverse domains using just a few examples. Our model is pre-trained on a large, heterogeneous collection of time series datasets, enabling it to learn generalizable temporal representations. It further incorporates architectural innovations such as dynamic convolutional layers for flexible channel adaptation and dataset token conditioning for domain-aware generation. Without requiring abundant supervision, our unified model achieves state-of-the-art performance in few-shot settings-outperforming domain-specific baselines across a wide range of subset sizes. Remarkably, it also surpasses all baselines even when tested on full datasets benchmarks, highlighting the strength of pre-training and cross-domain generalization. We hope this work encourages the community to revisit few-shot generative modeling as a key problem in time series research and pursue unified solutions that scale efficiently across domains.

Despite its simplicity and compact size (11M parameters), TabPFN-TS achieves top rank on the public GIFT-Eval leaderboard in both forecasting tasks. Through ablation studies, we investigate factors contributing to this surprising effectiveness, especially considering TabPFN-v2 was pretrained solely on synthetic tabular data with no exposure to time series. Our results highlights the potential of tabular foundation models like TabPFN-v2 as a valuable new approach for time series forecasting. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/PriorLabs/tabpfn-time-series.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version extends our NeurIPS 2024 workshop paper, The Tabular Foundation Model TabPFN Outperforms Specialized Time Series Forecasting Models Based on Simple Features, presented at the Table Representation Learning and Time Series in the Age of Large Models workshops</p></details> |
| **[Time-VLM: Exploring Multimodal Vision-Language Models for Augmented Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04395v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in time series forecasting have explored augmenting models with text or vision modalities to improve accuracy. While text provides contextual understanding, it often lacks fine-grained temporal details. Conversely, vision captures intricate temporal patterns but lacks semantic context, limiting the complementary potential of these modalities. To address this, we propose \method, a novel multimodal framework that leverages pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to bridge temporal, visual, and textual modalities for enhanced forecasting. Our framework comprises three key components: (1) a Retrieval-Augmented Learner, which extracts enriched temporal features through memory bank interactions; (2) a Vision-Augmented Learner, which encodes time series as informative images; and (3) a Text-Augmented Learner, which generates contextual textual descriptions. These components collaborate with frozen pre-trained VLMs to produce multimodal embeddings, which are then fused with temporal features for final prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Time-VLM achieves superior performance, particularly in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios, thereby establishing a new direction for multimodal time series forecasting.

| **[Synthetic Time Series Forecasting with Transformer Architectures: Extensive Simulation Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20048v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting plays a critical role in domains such as energy, finance, and healthcare, where accurate predictions inform decision-making under uncertainty. Although Transformer-based models have demonstrated success in sequential modeling, their adoption for time series remains limited by challenges such as noise sensitivity, long-range dependencies, and a lack of inductive bias for temporal structure. In this work, we present a unified and principled framework for benchmarking three prominent Transformer forecasting architectures-Autoformer, Informer, and Patchtst-each evaluated through three architectural variants: Minimal, Standard, and Full, representing increasing levels of complexity and modeling capacity. We conduct over 1500 controlled experiments on a suite of ten synthetic signals, spanning five patch lengths and five forecast horizons under both clean and noisy conditions. Our analysis reveals consistent patterns across model families. To advance this landscape further, we introduce the Koopman-enhanced Transformer framework, Deep Koopformer, which integrates operator-theoretic latent state modeling to improve stability and interpretability. We demonstrate its efficacy on nonlinear and chaotic dynamical systems. Our results highlight Koopman based Transformer as a promising hybrid approach for robust, interpretable, and theoretically grounded time series forecasting in noisy and complex real-world conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Time Series Processing for Transformers and State-Space Models through Token Merging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17951v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances in subquadratic attention mechanisms or state-space models, processing long token sequences still imposes significant computational requirements. Token merging has emerged as a solution to increase computational efficiency in computer vision architectures. In this work, we perform the first investigations of token merging in time series analysis on both transformers and state-space models. We further introduce local merging, a domain-specific token merging algorithm that selectively combines tokens within a local neighborhood, achieving two major benefits: a) Local merging can adjust its computational complexity from quadratic to linear based on the neighborhood size to effectively scale to long sequences; b) Local merging is the first causal merging scheme enabling token merging in transformer decoders. Further, we identify spectral properties of the input data that reliably predict the potential benefits of local merging without requiring evaluation on downstream tasks. Our comprehensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that local merging offers substantial efficiency gains with minimal impact on accuracy, achieving up to 5400% acceleration on the recently proposed Chronos foundation model.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages in total, 20 figures</p></details> |
| **[Using Time Structure to Estimate Causal Effects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11076v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There exist several approaches for estimating causal effects in time series when latent confounding is present. Many of these approaches rely on additional auxiliary observed variables or time series such as instruments, negative controls or time series that satisfy the front- or backdoor criterion in certain graphs. In this paper, we present a novel approach for estimating direct (and via Wright's path rule total) causal effects in a time series setup which does not rely on additional auxiliary observed variables or time series. This approach assumes that the underlying time series is a Structural Vector Autoregressive (SVAR) process and estimates direct causal effects by solving certain linear equation systems made up of different covariances and model parameters. We state sufficient graphical criteria in terms of the so-called full time graph under which these linear equations systems are uniquely solvable and under which their solutions contain the to-be-identified direct causal effects as components. We also state sufficient lag-based criteria under which the previously mentioned graphical conditions are satisfied and, thus, under which direct causal effects are identifiable. Several numerical experiments underline the correctness and applicability of our results.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages main paper, 30 pages Appendix, 56 pages in total, 3 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[CITRAS: Covariate-Informed Transformer for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24007v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In practical time series forecasting, covariates provide rich contextual information that can potentially enhance the forecast of target variables. Although some covariates extend into the future forecasting horizon (e.g., calendar events, discount schedules), most multivariate models fail to leverage this pivotal insight due to the length discrepancy with target variables. Additionally, capturing the dependency between target variables and covariates is non-trivial, as models must precisely reflect the local impact of covariates while also capturing global cross-variate dependencies. To overcome these challenges, we propose CITRAS, a decoder-only Transformer that flexibly leverages multiple targets, past covariates, and future covariates. While preserving strong autoregressive capabilities, CITRAS introduces two novel mechanisms in patch-wise cross-variate attention: Key-Value (KV) Shift and Attention Score Smoothing. KV Shift seamlessly incorporates future covariates into the forecasting of target variables based on their concurrent dependencies. Additionally, Attention Score Smoothing refines locally accurate patch-wise cross-variate dependencies into global variate-level dependencies by smoothing the past series of attention scores. Experimentally, CITRAS outperforms state-of-the-art models on thirteen real-world benchmarks from both covariate-informed and multivariate settings, demonstrating its versatile ability to leverage cross-variate and cross-time dependencies for improved forecasting accuracy.</p></details> |  |
