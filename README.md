| **[Decoding Futures Price Dynamics: A Regularized Sparse Autoencoder for Interpretable Multi-Horizon Forecasting and Factor Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06795v3)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Commodity price volatility creates economic challenges, necessitating accurate multi-horizon forecasting. Predicting prices for commodities like copper and crude oil is complicated by diverse interacting factors (macroeconomic, supply/demand, geopolitical, etc.). Current models often lack transparency, limiting strategic use. This paper presents a Regularized Sparse Autoencoder (RSAE), a deep learning framework for simultaneous multi-horizon commodity price prediction and discovery of interpretable latent market drivers. The RSAE forecasts prices at multiple horizons (e.g., 1-day, 1-week, 1-month) using multivariate time series. Crucially, L1 regularization ($\|\mathbf{z}\|_1$) on its latent vector $\mathbf{z}$ enforces sparsity, promoting parsimonious explanations of market dynamics through learned factors representing underlying drivers (e.g., demand, supply shocks). Drawing from energy-based models and sparse coding, the RSAE optimizes predictive accuracy while learning sparse representations. Evaluated on historical Copper and Crude Oil data with numerous indicators, our findings indicate the RSAE offers competitive multi-horizon forecasting accuracy and data-driven insights into price dynamics via its interpretable latent space, a key advantage over traditional black-box approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Call to Arms: AI Should be Critical for Social Media Analysis of Conflict Zones](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00810v3)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The massive proliferation of social media data represents a transformative opportunity for conflict studies and for tracking the proliferation and use of weaponry, as conflicts are increasingly documented in these online spaces. At the same time, the scale and types of data available are problematic for traditional open-source intelligence. This paper focuses on identifying specific weapon systems and the insignias of the armed groups using them as documented in the Ukraine war, as these tasks are critical to operational intelligence and tracking weapon proliferation, especially given the scale of international military aid given to Ukraine. The large scale of social media makes manual assessment difficult, however, so this paper presents early work that uses computer vision models to support this task. We demonstrate that these models can both identify weapons embedded in images shared in social media and how the resulting collection of military-relevant images and their post times interact with the offline, real-world conflict. Not only can we then track changes in the prevalence of images of tanks, land mines, military trucks, etc., we find correlations among time series data associated with these images and the daily fatalities in this conflict. This work shows substantial opportunity for examining similar online documentation of conflict contexts, and we also point to future avenues where computer vision can be further improved for these open-source intelligence tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[ARCANE -- Early Detection of Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09365v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) are major drivers of space weather disturbances, posing risks to both technological infrastructure and human activities. Automatic detection of ICMEs in solar wind in situ data is essential for early warning systems. While several methods have been proposed to identify these structures in time series data, robust real-time detection remains a significant challenge. In this work, we present ARCANE - the first framework explicitly designed for early ICME detection in streaming solar wind data under realistic operational constraints, enabling event identification without requiring observation of the full structure. Our approach evaluates the strengths and limitations of detection models by comparing a machine learning-based method to a threshold-based baseline. The ResUNet++ model, previously validated on science data, significantly outperforms the baseline, particularly in detecting high-impact events, while retaining solid performance on lower-impact cases. Notably, we find that using real-time solar wind (RTSW) data instead of high-resolution science data leads to only minimal performance degradation. Despite the challenges of operational settings, our detection pipeline achieves an F1 score of 0.53, with an average detection delay of 21.5% of the event's duration while only seeing a minimal amount of data. As more data becomes available, the performance increases significantly. These results mark a substantial step forward in automated space weather monitoring and lay the groundwork for enhanced real-time forecasting capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 9 figures, 1 table, submitted to AGU Space Weather on 14th May 2025</p></details> |
| **[DACAD: Domain Adaptation Contrastive Learning for Anomaly Detection in Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11269v3)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In time series anomaly detection (TSAD), the scarcity of labeled data poses a challenge to the development of accurate models. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) offers a solution by leveraging labeled data from a related domain to detect anomalies in an unlabeled target domain. However, existing UDA methods assume consistent anomalous classes across domains. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Domain Adaptation Contrastive learning model for Anomaly Detection in multivariate time series (DACAD), combining UDA with contrastive learning. DACAD utilizes an anomaly injection mechanism that enhances generalization across unseen anomalous classes, improving adaptability and robustness. Additionally, our model employs supervised contrastive loss for the source domain and self-supervised contrastive triplet loss for the target domain, ensuring comprehensive feature representation learning and domain-invariant feature extraction. Finally, an effective Center-based Entropy Classifier (CEC) accurately learns normal boundaries in the source domain. Extensive evaluations on multiple real-world datasets and a synthetic dataset highlight DACAD's superior performance in transferring knowledge across domains and mitigating the challenge of limited labeled data in TSAD.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[OLinear: A Linear Model for Time Series Forecasting in Orthogonally Transformed Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08550v2)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents $\mathbf{OLinear}$, a $\mathbf{linear}$-based multivariate time series forecasting model that operates in an $\mathbf{o}$rthogonally transformed domain. Recent forecasting models typically adopt the temporal forecast (TF) paradigm, which directly encode and decode time series in the time domain. However, the entangled step-wise dependencies in series data can hinder the performance of TF. To address this, some forecasters conduct encoding and decoding in the transformed domain using fixed, dataset-independent bases (e.g., sine and cosine signals in the Fourier transform). In contrast, we utilize $\mathbf{OrthoTrans}$, a data-adaptive transformation based on an orthogonal matrix that diagonalizes the series' temporal Pearson correlation matrix. This approach enables more effective encoding and decoding in the decorrelated feature domain and can serve as a plug-in module to enhance existing forecasters. To enhance the representation learning for multivariate time series, we introduce a customized linear layer, $\mathbf{NormLin}$, which employs a normalized weight matrix to capture multivariate dependencies. Empirically, the NormLin module shows a surprising performance advantage over multi-head self-attention, while requiring nearly half the FLOPs. Extensive experiments on 24 benchmarks and 140 forecasting tasks demonstrate that OLinear consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency. Notably, as a plug-in replacement for self-attention, the NormLin module consistently enhances Transformer-based forecasters. The code and datasets are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/OLinear</p></details> |  |
| **[METDrive: Multi-modal End-to-end Autonomous Driving with Temporal Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12667v3)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal end-to-end autonomous driving has shown promising advancements in recent work. By embedding more modalities into end-to-end networks, the system's understanding of both static and dynamic aspects of the driving environment is enhanced, thereby improving the safety of autonomous driving. In this paper, we introduce METDrive, an end-to-end system that leverages temporal guidance from the embedded time series features of ego states, including rotation angles, steering, throttle signals, and waypoint vectors. The geometric features derived from perception sensor data and the time series features of ego state data jointly guide the waypoint prediction with the proposed temporal guidance loss function. We evaluated METDrive on the CARLA leaderboard benchmarks, achieving a driving score of 70%, a route completion score of 94%, and an infraction score of 0.78.</p></details> | Accepted by ICRA |
| **[Estimation of large approximate dynamic matrix factor models based on the EM algorithm and Kalman filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04112v2)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper considers an approximate dynamic matrix factor model that accounts for the time series nature of the data by explicitly modelling the time evolution of the factors. We study estimation of the model parameters based on the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, implemented jointly with the Kalman smoother which gives estimates of the factors. We establish the consistency of the estimated loadings and factor matrices as the sample size $T$ and the matrix dimensions $p_1$ and $p_2$ diverge to infinity. We then illustrate two immediate extensions of this approach to: (a) the case of arbitrary patterns of missing data and (b) the presence of common stochastic trends. The finite sample properties of the estimators are assessed through a large simulation study and two applications on: (i) a financial dataset of volatility proxies and (ii) a macroeconomic dataset covering the main euro area countries.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deployable and Generalizable Motion Prediction: Taxonomy, Open Challenges and Future Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09074v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion prediction, the anticipation of future agent states or scene evolution, is rooted in human cognition, bridging perception and decision-making. It enables intelligent systems, such as robots and self-driving cars, to act safely in dynamic, human-involved environments, and informs broader time-series reasoning challenges. With advances in methods, representations, and datasets, the field has seen rapid progress, reflected in quickly evolving benchmark results. Yet, when state-of-the-art methods are deployed in the real world, they often struggle to generalize to open-world conditions and fall short of deployment standards. This reveals a gap between research benchmarks, which are often idealized or ill-posed, and real-world complexity. To address this gap, this survey revisits the generalization and deployability of motion prediction models, with an emphasis on the applications of robotics, autonomous driving, and human motion. We first offer a comprehensive taxonomy of motion prediction methods, covering representations, modeling strategies, application domains, and evaluation protocols. We then study two key challenges: (1) how to push motion prediction models to be deployable to realistic deployment standards, where motion prediction does not act in a vacuum, but functions as one module of closed-loop autonomy stacks - it takes input from the localization and perception, and informs downstream planning and control. 2) how to generalize motion prediction models from limited seen scenarios/datasets to the open-world settings. Throughout the paper, we highlight critical open challenges to guide future work, aiming to recalibrate the community's efforts, fostering progress that is not only measurable but also meaningful for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Initi...</summary><p>Initial draft, 162 pages, 40 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |
| **[Reach-Avoid-Stabilize Using Admissible Control Sets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09058v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability (HJR) analysis has been successfully used in many robotics and control tasks, and is especially effective in computing reach-avoid sets and control laws that enable an agent to reach a goal while satisfying state constraints. However, the original HJR formulation provides no guarantees of safety after a) the prescribed time horizon, or b) goal satisfaction. The reach-avoid-stabilize (RAS) problem has therefore gained a lot of focus: find the set of initial states (the RAS set), such that the trajectory can reach the target, and stabilize to some point of interest (POI) while avoiding obstacles. Solving RAS problems using HJR usually requires defining a new value function, whose zero sub-level set is the RAS set. The existing methods do not consider the problem when there are a series of targets to reach and/or obstacles to avoid. We propose a method that uses the idea of admissible control sets; we guarantee that the system will reach each target while avoiding obstacles as prescribed by the given time series. Moreover, we guarantee that the trajectory ultimately stabilizes to the POI. The proposed method provides an under-approximation of the RAS set, guaranteeing safety. Numerical examples are provided to validate the theory.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, submitted to 64th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal Fusion of Glucose Monitoring and Food Imagery for Caloric Content Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09018v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective dietary monitoring is critical for managing Type 2 diabetes, yet accurately estimating caloric intake remains a major challenge. While continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) offer valuable physiological data, they often fall short in capturing the full nutritional profile of meals due to inter-individual and meal-specific variability. In this work, we introduce a multimodal deep learning framework that jointly leverages CGM time-series data, Demographic/Microbiome, and pre-meal food images to enhance caloric estimation. Our model utilizes attention based encoding and a convolutional feature extraction for meal imagery, multi-layer perceptrons for CGM and Microbiome data followed by a late fusion strategy for joint reasoning. We evaluate our approach on a curated dataset of over 40 participants, incorporating synchronized CGM, Demographic and Microbiome data and meal photographs with standardized caloric labels. Our model achieves a Root Mean Squared Relative Error (RMSRE) of 0.2544, outperforming the baselines models by over 50%. These findings demonstrate the potential of multimodal sensing to improve automated dietary assessment tools for chronic disease management.</p></details> |  |
| **[Forecasting intermittent time series with Gaussian Processes and Tweedie likelihood](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19086v3)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We adopt Gaussian Processes (GPs) as latent functions for probabilistic forecasting of intermittent time series. The model is trained in a Bayesian framework that accounts for the uncertainty about the latent function and marginalizes it out when making predictions. We couple the latent GP variable with two types of forecast distributions: the negative binomial (NegBinGP) and the Tweedie distribution (TweedieGP). While the negative binomial has already been used in forecasting intermittent time series, this is the first time in which a fully parameterized Tweedie density is used for intermittent time series. We properly evaluate the Tweedie density, which has both a point mass at zero and heavy tails, avoiding simplifying assumptions made in existing models. We test our models on thousands of intermittent count time series. Results show that our models provide consistently better probabilistic forecasts than the competitors. In particular, TweedieGP obtains the best estimates of the highest quantiles, thus showing that it is more flexible than NegBinGP.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Causal Feedback Discovery using Convergence Cross Mapping from Sea Ice Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09001v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Arctic region is experiencing accelerated warming, largely driven by complex and nonlinear interactions among time series atmospheric variables such as, sea ice extent, short-wave radiation, temperature, and humidity. These interactions significantly alter sea ice dynamics and atmospheric conditions, leading to increased sea ice loss. This loss further intensifies Arctic amplification and disrupts weather patterns through various feedback mechanisms. Although stochastic methods such as Granger causality, PCMCI, and VarLiNGAM estimate causal interactions among atmospheric variables, they are limited to unidirectional causal relationships and often miss weak causal interactions and feedback loops in nonlinear settings. In this study, we show that Convergent Cross Mapping (CCM) can effectively estimate nonlinear causal coupling, identify weak interactions and causal feedback loops among atmospheric variables. CCM employs state space reconstruction (SSR) which makes it suitable for complex nonlinear dynamic systems. While CCM has been successfully applied to a diverse range of systems, including fisheries and online social networks, its application in climate science is under-explored. Our results show that CCM effectively uncovers strong nonlinear causal feedback loops and weak causal interactions often overlooked by stochastic methods in complex nonlinear dynamic atmospheric systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPAT: Sensitivity-based Multihead-attention Pruning on Time Series Forecasting Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08768v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attention-based architectures have achieved superior performance in multivariate time series forecasting but are computationally expensive. Techniques such as patching and adaptive masking have been developed to reduce their sizes and latencies. In this work, we propose a structured pruning method, SPAT ($\textbf{S}$ensitivity $\textbf{P}$runer for $\textbf{At}$tention), which selectively removes redundant attention mechanisms and yields highly effective models. Different from previous approaches, SPAT aims to remove the entire attention module, which reduces the risk of overfitting and enables speed-up without demanding specialized hardware. We propose a dynamic sensitivity metric, $\textbf{S}$ensitivity $\textbf{E}$nhanced $\textbf{N}$ormalized $\textbf{D}$ispersion (SEND) that measures the importance of each attention module during the pre-training phase. Experiments on multivariate datasets demonstrate that SPAT-pruned models achieve reductions of 2.842% in MSE, 1.996% in MAE, and 35.274% in FLOPs. Furthermore, SPAT-pruned models outperform existing lightweight, Mamba-based and LLM-based SOTA methods in both standard and zero-shot inference, highlighting the importance of retaining only the most effective attention mechanisms. We have made our code publicly available https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SPAT-6042.</p></details> |  |
| **[Implet: A Post-hoc Subsequence Explainer for Time Series Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08748v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explainability in time series models is crucial for fostering trust, facilitating debugging, and ensuring interpretability in real-world applications. In this work, we introduce Implet, a novel post-hoc explainer that generates accurate and concise subsequence-level explanations for time series models. Our approach identifies critical temporal segments that significantly contribute to the model's predictions, providing enhanced interpretability beyond traditional feature-attribution methods. Based on it, we propose a cohort-based (group-level) explanation framework designed to further improve the conciseness and interpretability of our explanations. We evaluate Implet on several standard time-series classification benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving interpretability. The code is available at https://github.com/LbzSteven/implet</p></details> |  |
| **[TiMo: Spatiotemporal Foundation Model for Satellite Image Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08723v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Satellite image time series (SITS) provide continuous observations of the Earth's surface, making them essential for applications such as environmental management and disaster assessment. However, existing spatiotemporal foundation models rely on plain vision transformers, which encode entire temporal sequences without explicitly capturing multiscale spatiotemporal relationships between land objects. This limitation hinders their effectiveness in downstream tasks. To overcome this challenge, we propose TiMo, a novel hierarchical vision transformer foundation model tailored for SITS analysis. At its core, we introduce a spatiotemporal gyroscope attention mechanism that dynamically captures evolving multiscale patterns across both time and space. For pre-training, we curate MillionST, a large-scale dataset of one million images from 100,000 geographic locations, each captured across 10 temporal phases over five years, encompassing diverse geospatial changes and seasonal variations. Leveraging this dataset, we adapt masked image modeling to pre-train TiMo, enabling it to effectively learn and encode generalizable spatiotemporal representations.Extensive experiments across multiple spatiotemporal tasks-including deforestation monitoring, land cover segmentation, crop type classification, and flood detection-demonstrate TiMo's superiority over state-of-the-art methods. Code, model, and dataset will be released at https://github.com/MiliLab/TiMo.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sparse High-Dimensional Vector Autoregressive Bootstrap](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01233v2)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a high-dimensional multiplier bootstrap for time series data based on capturing dependence through a sparsely estimated vector autoregressive model. We prove its consistency for inference on high-dimensional means under two different moment assumptions on the errors, namely sub-gaussian moments and a finite number of absolute moments. In establishing these results, we derive a Gaussian approximation for the maximum mean of a linear process, which may be of independent interest.</p></details> |  |
| **[From S4 to Mamba: A Comprehensive Survey on Structured State Space Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18970v2)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in sequence modeling have led to the emergence of Structured State Space Models (SSMs) as an efficient alternative to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers, addressing challenges in long-range dependency modeling and computational efficiency. While RNNs suffer from vanishing gradients and sequential inefficiencies, and Transformers face quadratic complexity, SSMs leverage structured recurrence and state-space representations to achieve superior long-sequence processing with linear or near-linear complexity. This survey provides a comprehensive review of SSMs, tracing their evolution from the foundational S4 model to its successors like Mamba, Simplified Structured State Space Sequence Model (S5), and Jamba, highlighting their improvements in computational efficiency, memory optimization, and inference speed. By comparing SSMs with traditional sequence models across domains such as natural language processing (NLP), speech recognition, vision, and time-series forecasting, we demonstrate their advantages in handling long-range dependencies while reducing computational overhead. Despite their potential, challenges remain in areas such as training optimization, hybrid modeling, and interpretability. This survey serves as a structured guide for researchers and practitioners, detailing the advancements, trade-offs, and future directions of SSM-based architectures in AI and deep learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[A Study of Data-driven Methods for Inventory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08673v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper shows a comprehensive analysis of three algorithms (Time Series, Random Forest (RF) and Deep Reinforcement Learning) into three inventory models (the Lost Sales, Dual-Sourcing and Multi-Echelon Inventory Model). These methodologies are applied in the supermarket context. The main purpose is to analyse efficient methods for the data-driven. Their possibility, potential and current challenges are taken into consideration in this report. By comparing the results in each model, the effectiveness of each algorithm is evaluated based on several key performance indicators, including forecast accuracy, adaptability to market changes, and overall impact on inventory costs and customer satisfaction levels. The data visualization tools and statistical metrics are the indicators for the comparisons and show some obvious trends and patterns that can guide decision-making in inventory management. These tools enable managers to not only track the performance of different algorithms in real-time but also to drill down into specific data points to understand the underlying causes of inventory fluctuations. This level of detail is crucial for pinpointing inefficiencies and areas for improvement within the supply chain.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Simplification Algorithms for Interpretability of Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08846v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we introduce metrics to evaluate the use of simplified time series in the context of interpretability of a TSC - a Time Series Classifier. Such simplifications are important because time series data, in contrast to text and image data, are not intuitively understandable to humans. These metrics are related to the complexity of the simplifications - how many segments they contain - and to their loyalty - how likely they are to maintain the classification of the original time series. We employ these metrics to evaluate four distinct simplification algorithms, across several TSC algorithms and across datasets of varying characteristics, from seasonal or stationary to short or long. Our findings suggest that using simplifications for interpretability of TSC is much better than using the original time series, particularly when the time series are seasonal, non-stationary and/or with low entropy.</p></details> |  |
| **[MINIMALIST: switched-capacitor circuits for efficient in-memory computation of gated recurrent units](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08599v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been a long-standing candidate for processing of temporal sequence data, especially in memory-constrained systems that one may find in embedded edge computing environments. Recent advances in training paradigms have now inspired new generations of efficient RNNs. We introduce a streamlined and hardware-compatible architecture based on minimal gated recurrent units (GRUs), and an accompanying efficient mixed-signal hardware implementation of the model. The proposed design leverages switched-capacitor circuits not only for in-memory computation (IMC), but also for the gated state updates. The mixed-signal cores rely solely on commodity circuits consisting of metal capacitors, transmission gates, and a clocked comparator, thus greatly facilitating scaling and transfer to other technology nodes. We benchmark the performance of our architecture on time series data, introducing all constraints required for a direct mapping to the hardware system. The direct compatibility is verified in mixed-signal simulations, reproducing data recorded from the software-only network model.</p></details> |  |

The framework incorporates a diffusion model tailored for time series generation to enhance the accuracy of the load forecasting module used in the system operation. In the absence of explicit state transition law, a model-identification procedure is leveraged to derive the system dynamics, thereby eliminating a barrier when applying MPC to a renewables-dominated power system. Case study results on an industry park system and the IEEE 30-bus system demonstrate that using the diffusion model to augment the training dataset significantly improves load-forecasting accuracy, and the inferred system dynamics are applicable to the real-time grid operation with solar and wind.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by the 2025 IEEE PES General Meeting (PESGM), which will be held in Austin, TX, July 27-31, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Learning Advanced Self-Attention for Linear Transformers in the Singular Value Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08516v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse domains. The key component of Transformers is self-attention, which learns the relationship between any two tokens in the input sequence. Recent studies have revealed that the self-attention can be understood as a normalized adjacency matrix of a graph. Notably, from the perspective of graph signal processing (GSP), the self-attention can be equivalently defined as a simple graph filter, applying GSP using the value vector as the signal. However, the self-attention is a graph filter defined with only the first order of the polynomial matrix, and acts as a low-pass filter preventing the effective leverage of various frequency information. Consequently, existing self-attention mechanisms are designed in a rather simplified manner. Therefore, we propose a novel method, called \underline{\textbf{A}}ttentive \underline{\textbf{G}}raph \underline{\textbf{F}}ilter (AGF), interpreting the self-attention as learning the graph filter in the singular value domain from the perspective of graph signal processing for directed graphs with the linear complexity w.r.t. the input length $n$, i.e., $\mathcal{O}(nd^2)$. In our experiments, we demonstrate that AGF achieves state-of-the-art performance on various tasks, including Long Range Arena benchmark and time series classification.</p></details> | IJCAI25 Accepted |
| **[Early Detection of Forest Calamities in Homogeneous Stands -- Deep Learning Applied to Bark-Beetle Outbreaks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12883v2)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Climate change has increased the vulnerability of forests to insect-related damage, resulting in widespread forest loss in Central Europe and highlighting the need for effective, continuous monitoring systems. Remote sensing based forest health monitoring, oftentimes, relies on supervised machine learning algorithms that require labeled training data. Monitoring temporal patterns through time series analysis offers a potential alternative for earlier detection of disturbance but requires substantial storage resources. This study investigates the potential of a Deep Learning algorithm based on a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Autoencoder for the detection of anomalies in forest health (e.g. bark beetle outbreaks), utilizing Sentinel-2 time series data. This approach is an alternative to supervised machine learning methods, avoiding the necessity for labeled training data. Furthermore, it is more memory-efficient than other time series analysis approaches, as a robust model can be created using only a 26-week-long time series as input. In this study, we monitored pure stands of spruce in Thuringia, Germany, over a 7-year period from 2018 to the end of 2024. Our best model achieved a detection accuracy of 87% on test data and was able to detect 61% of all anomalies at a very early stage (more than a month before visible signs of forest degradation). Compared to another widely used time series break detection algorithm - BFAST (Breaks For Additive Season and Trend), our approach consistently detected higher percentage of anomalies at an earlier stage. These findings suggest that LSTM-based Autoencoders could provide a promising, resource-efficient approach to forest health monitoring, enabling more timely responses to emerging threats.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 18 figures, submitted to IEEE: Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Unstructured Pruning of Mamba State-Space Models for Resource-Constrained Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08299v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-space models (SSMs), particularly the Mamba architecture, have emerged as powerful alternatives to Transformers for sequence modeling, offering linear-time complexity and competitive performance across diverse tasks. However, their large parameter counts pose significant challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments. We propose a novel unstructured pruning framework tailored for Mamba models that achieves up to 70\% parameter reduction while retaining over 95\% of the original performance. Our approach integrates three key innovations: (1) a gradient-aware magnitude pruning technique that combines weight magnitude and gradient information to identify less critical parameters, (2) an iterative pruning schedule that gradually increases sparsity to maintain model stability, and (3) a global pruning strategy that optimizes parameter allocation across the entire model. Through extensive experiments on WikiText-103, Long Range Arena, and ETT time-series benchmarks, we demonstrate significant efficiency gains with minimal performance degradation. Our analysis of pruning effects on Mamba's components reveals critical insights into the architecture's redundancy and robustness, enabling practical deployment in resource-constrained settings while broadening Mamba's applicability.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multi-scale Representation Learning Framework for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08199v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) offers broad utility in practical settings like energy consumption and weather prediction. Accurately predicting long-term changes, however, is demanding due to the intricate temporal patterns and inherent multi-scale variations within time series. This work confronts key issues in LTSF, including the suboptimal use of multi-granularity information, the neglect of channel-specific attributes, and the unique nature of trend and seasonal components, by introducing a proficient MLP-based forecasting framework. Our method adeptly disentangles complex temporal dynamics using clear, concurrent predictions across various scales. These multi-scale forecasts are then skillfully integrated through a system that dynamically assigns importance to information from different granularities, sensitive to individual channel characteristics. To manage the specific features of temporal patterns, a two-pronged structure is utilized to model trend and seasonal elements independently. Experimental results on eight LTSF benchmarks demonstrate that MDMixer improves average MAE performance by 4.64% compared to the recent state-of-the-art MLP-based method (TimeMixer), while achieving an effective balance between training efficiency and model interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Feature Fitted Online Conformal Prediction for Deep Time Series Forecasting Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08158v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is critical for many applications, where deep learning-based point prediction models have demonstrated strong performance. However, in practical scenarios, there is also a need to quantify predictive uncertainty through online confidence intervals. Existing confidence interval modeling approaches building upon these deep point prediction models suffer from key limitations: they either require costly retraining, fail to fully leverage the representational strengths of deep models, or lack theoretical guarantees. To address these gaps, we propose a lightweight conformal prediction method that provides valid coverage and shorter interval lengths without retraining. Our approach leverages features extracted from pre-trained point prediction models to fit a residual predictor and construct confidence intervals, further enhanced by an adaptive coverage control mechanism. Theoretically, we prove that our method achieves asymptotic coverage convergence, with error bounds dependent on the feature quality of the underlying point prediction model. Experiments on 12 datasets demonstrate that our method delivers tighter confidence intervals while maintaining desired coverage rates.

| **[PoisonCatcher: Revealing and Identifying LDP Poisoning Attacks in IIoT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15704v2)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Local Differential Privacy (LDP), a robust privacy-protection model, is widely adopted in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) due to its lightweight, decentralized, and scalable. However, its perturbation-based privacy-protection mechanism hinders distinguishing between any two data, thereby facilitating LDP poisoning attacks. The exposed physical-layer vulnerabilities and resource-constrained prevalent at the IIoT edge not only facilitate such attacks but also render existing LDP poisoning defenses, all of which are deployed at the edge and rely on ample resources, impractical. This work proposes a LDP poisoning defense for IIoT in the resource-rich aggregator. We first reveal key poisoning attack modes occurring within the LDP-utilized IIoT data-collection process, detailing how IIoT vulnerabilities enable attacks, and then formulate a general attack model and derive the poisoned data's indistinguishability. This work subsequently analyzes the poisoning impacts on aggregated data based on industrial process correlation, revealing the distortion of statistical query results' temporal similarity and the resulting disruption of inter-attribute correlation, and uncovering the intriguing paradox that adversaries' attempts to stabilize their poisoning actions for stealth are difficult to maintain. Given these findings, we propose PoisonCatcher, a solution for identifying poisoned data, which includes time-series detectors based on temporal similarity, attribute correlation, and pattern stability metrics to detect poisoned attributes, and a latent-bias feature miner for identifying poisons. Experiments on the real-world dataset indicate that PoisonCatcher successfully identifies poisoned data, demonstrating robust identification capabilities with F2 scores above 90.7\% under various attack settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages,7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Foundation Models Knowledge Distillation For Battery Capacity Degradation Forecast](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08151v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate estimation of lithium-ion battery capacity degradation is critical for enhancing the reliability and safety of battery operations. Traditional expert models, tailored to specific scenarios, provide isolated estimations. With the rapid advancement of data-driven techniques, a series of general-purpose time-series foundation models have been developed. However, foundation models specifically designed for battery capacity degradation remain largely unexplored. To enable zero-shot generalization in battery degradation prediction using large model technology, this study proposes a degradation-aware fine-tuning strategy for time-series foundation models. We apply this strategy to fine-tune the Timer model on approximately 10 GB of open-source battery charge discharge data. Validation on our released CycleLife-SJTUIE dataset demonstrates that the fine-tuned Battery-Timer possesses strong zero-shot generalization capability in capacity degradation forecasting. To address the computational challenges of deploying large models, we further propose a knowledge distillation framework that transfers the knowledge of pre-trained foundation models into compact expert models. Distillation results across several state-of-the-art time-series expert models confirm that foundation model knowledge significantly improves the multi-condition generalization of expert models.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comparative Study of Transformer-Based Models for Multi-Horizon Blood Glucose Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08821v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate blood glucose prediction can enable novel interventions for type 1 diabetes treatment, including personalized insulin and dietary adjustments. Although recent advances in transformer-based architectures have demonstrated the power of attention mechanisms in complex multivariate time series prediction, their potential for blood glucose (BG) prediction remains underexplored. We present a comparative analysis of transformer models for multi-horizon BG prediction, examining forecasts up to 4 hours and input history up to 1 week. The publicly available DCLP3 dataset (n=112) was split (80%-10%-10%) for training, validation, and testing, and the OhioT1DM dataset (n=12) served as an external test set. We trained networks with point-wise, patch-wise, series-wise, and hybrid embeddings, using CGM, insulin, and meal data. For short-term blood glucose prediction, Crossformer, a patch-wise transformer architecture, achieved a superior 30-minute prediction of RMSE (15.6 mg / dL on OhioT1DM). For longer-term predictions (1h, 2h, and 4h), PatchTST, another path-wise transformer, prevailed with the lowest RMSE (24.6 mg/dL, 36.1 mg/dL, and 46.5 mg/dL on OhioT1DM). In general, models that used tokenization through patches demonstrated improved accuracy with larger input sizes, with the best results obtained with a one-week history. These findings highlight the promise of transformer-based architectures for BG prediction by capturing and leveraging seasonal patterns in multivariate time-series data to improve accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, 1 table, 1st IFAC Workshop on Engineering Diabetes Technologies (EDT 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Time-varying Parameter Tensor Vector Autoregression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07975v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-varying parameter vector autoregression provides a flexible framework to capture structural changes within time series. However, when applied to high-dimensional data, this model encounters challenges of over-parametrization and computational burden. We address these challenges by building on recently proposed Tensor VAR models to represent the time-varying coefficient matrix as a third-order tensor with CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition, yielding three model configurations where different sets of components are specified as time-varying, each offering distinct interpretations. To select the model configuration and the decomposition rank, we evaluate multiple variants of Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) corresponding to the conditional and marginal DICs. Our simulation demonstrates that a specific conditional DIC variant provides more reliable results and accurately identifies true model configurations. We improve the accuracy of rank selection by applying knee point detection to the DICs, rather than defaulting to the minimum DIC value. Upon analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging data from story reading tasks, our selected model configurations suggest time-varying dynamics while reducing the number of parameters by over 90% relative to standard VARs. Granger causality analysis reveals directional brain connectivity patterns that align with narrative progression, with various regions functioning as signal emitters or receivers at different time points.</p></details> |  |
| **[4TaStiC: Time and trend traveling time series clustering for classifying long-term type 2 diabetes patients](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07702v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diabetes is one of the most prevalent diseases worldwide, characterized by persistently high blood sugar levels, capable of damaging various internal organs and systems. Diabetes patients require routine check-ups, resulting in a time series of laboratory records, such as hemoglobin A1c, which reflects each patient's health behavior over time and informs their doctor's recommendations. Clustering patients into groups based on their entire time series data assists doctors in making recommendations and choosing treatments without the need to review all records. However, time series clustering of this type of dataset introduces some challenges; patients visit their doctors at different time points, making it difficult to capture and match trends, peaks, and patterns. Additionally, two aspects must be considered: differences in the levels of laboratory results and differences in trends and patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce a new clustering algorithm called Time and Trend Traveling Time Series Clustering (4TaStiC), using a base dissimilarity measure combined with Euclidean and Pearson correlation metrics. We evaluated this algorithm on artificial datasets, comparing its performance with that of seven existing methods. The results show that 4TaStiC outperformed the other methods on the targeted datasets. Finally, we applied 4TaStiC to cluster a cohort of 1,989 type 2 diabetes patients at Siriraj Hospital. Each group of patients exhibits clear characteristics that will benefit doctors in making efficient clinical decisions. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm can be applied to contexts outside the medical field.</p></details> |  |

Foundation models, pre-trained on diverse datasets, can be applied in a zero-shot setting with minimal data or further improved through finetuning. We compare Google's TimesFM model to conventional parametric and non-parametric models, including GARCH and Generalized Autoregressive Score (GAS), using 19 years of daily returns from the SP 100 index and its constituents. Backtesting with over 8.5 years of out-of-sample data shows that the fine-tuned foundation model consistently outperforms traditional methods in actual-over-expected ratios. For the quantile score loss function, it performs comparably to the best econometric model, GAS. Overall, the foundation model ranks as the best or among the top performers across the 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 quantile forecasting. Fine-tuning significantly improves accuracy, showing that zero-shot use is not optimal for VaR.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedualTime: A Dual-Adapter Language Model for Medical Time Series-Text Multimodal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06620v3)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent rapid advancements in language models (LMs) have garnered attention in medical time series-text multimodal learning. However, existing contrastive learning-based and prompt-based LM approaches tend to be biased, often assigning a primary role to time series modality while treating text modality as secondary. We classify these approaches under a temporal-primary paradigm, which may overlook the unique and critical task-relevant information embedded in text modality like clinical reports, thus failing to fully leverage mutual benefits and complementarity of different modalities. To fill this gap, we propose a novel textual-temporal multimodal learning paradigm that enables either modality to serve as the primary while being enhanced by the other, thereby effectively capturing modality-specific information and fostering cross-modal interaction. In specific, we design MedualTime, a language model composed of dual adapters to implement temporal-primary and textual-primary modeling simultaneously. Within each adapter, lightweight adaptation tokens are injected into the top layers of LM to encourage high-level modality fusion. The shared LM pipeline by dual adapters not only achieves adapter alignment but also enables efficient fine-tuning, reducing computational resources. Empirically, MedualTime demonstrates superior performance on medical data, achieving notable improvements of 8% accuracy and 12% F1 in supervised settings. Furthermore, MedualTime's transferability is validated by few-shot label transfer experiments from coarse-grained to fine-grained medical data. https://github.com/start2020/MedualTime</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figure, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Transfer Learning with Foundational Models for Time Series Forecasting using Low-Rank Adaptations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11539v3)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundational Models are an emerging widely used technique of GenAI. These models are distinguished by their scalability and the ease with which they can be adapted through the exploitation of Transfer Learning. The availability of high computational power and large datasets have supported their development, achieving a high generalization capacity due to the enormous and heterogeneous amounts of data used in their initial training. These characteristics contribute to a solid base that can be adapted or adjusted to a wide range of tasks, increasing their applicability. This study proposes the methodology LLIAM, a straightforward adaptation of a kind of FM, Large Language Models, for the Time Series Forecasting task. An adequate time-series prompting schema and Low-Rank Adaptations are used to enhance the knowledge of the model with diverse time series datasets, known as the fine-tuning phase. A study divided in two stages has been performed for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. Initially, a comparison was made between the performance of LLIAM and different state-of-the-art DL algorithms, including Recurrent Neural Networks and Temporal Convolutional Networks, as well as a LLM-based method, TimeLLM. Following this, a zero-shot study is presented in order to evaluate the generalization capacity of the proposed methodology with time series datasets from unknown domains not considered in the model training. The outcomes of this investigation demonstrate the efficacy of LLIAM, highlighting that this straightforward and general approach can attain competent results without the necessity for applying complex modifications. This work also encourages the use of available resources (such as these pre-trained models) and efficient fine-tuning techniques to avoid unnecessary and costly training, narrowing the gap between the goals of traditional AI and Green AI.</p></details> |  |

To address this question, one of us has collected a time series of data for social interactions between chimpanzees. Here we use a network representation, leading to the task of combining these data into a time series of a single weighted network per time stamp, where different proximities should be given different weights reflecting their relative importance. We optimize these proximity-type weights in a principled way, using an innovative loss function which rewards structural consistency across time. The approach is empirically validated by carefully designed synthetic data. Using statistical tests, we provide a way of identifying groups of individuals that stay related for a significant length of time. Applying the approach to the chimpanzee data set, we detect cliques in the animal social network time series, which can be validated by real-world intuition from prior research and qualitative observations by chimpanzee experts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamical Label Augmentation and Calibration for Noisy Electronic Health Records](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07320v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical research, particularly in predicting patient outcomes, heavily relies on medical time series data extracted from Electronic Health Records (EHR), which provide extensive information on patient histories. Despite rigorous examination, labeling errors are inevitable and can significantly impede accurate predictions of patient outcome. To address this challenge, we propose an \textbf{A}ttention-based Learning Framework with Dynamic \textbf{C}alibration and Augmentation for \textbf{T}ime series Noisy \textbf{L}abel \textbf{L}earning (ACTLL). This framework leverages a two-component Beta mixture model to identify the certain and uncertain sets of instances based on the fitness distribution of each class, and it captures global temporal dynamics while dynamically calibrating labels from the uncertain set or augmenting confident instances from the certain set. Experimental results on large-scale EHR datasets eICU and MIMIC-IV-ED, and several benchmark datasets from the UCR and UEA repositories, demonstrate that our model ACTLL has achieved state-of-the-art performance, especially under high noise levels.</p></details> |  |
| **[FCPCA: Fuzzy clustering of high-dimensional time series based on common principal component analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07276v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clustering multivariate time series data is a crucial task in many domains, as it enables the identification of meaningful patterns and groups in time-evolving data. Traditional approaches, such as crisp clustering, rely on the assumption that clusters are sufficiently separated with little overlap. However, real-world data often defy this assumption, exhibiting overlapping distributions or overlapping clouds of points and blurred boundaries between clusters. Fuzzy clustering offers a compelling alternative by allowing partial membership in multiple clusters, making it well-suited for these ambiguous scenarios. Despite its advantages, current fuzzy clustering methods primarily focus on univariate time series, and for multivariate cases, even datasets of moderate dimensionality become computationally prohibitive. This challenge is further exacerbated when dealing with time series of varying lengths, leaving a clear gap in addressing the complexities of modern datasets. This work introduces a novel fuzzy clustering approach based on common principal component analysis to address the aforementioned shortcomings. Our method has the advantage of efficiently handling high-dimensional multivariate time series by reducing dimensionality while preserving critical temporal features. Extensive numerical results show that our proposed clustering method outperforms several existing approaches in the literature. An interesting application involving brain signals from different drivers recorded from a simulated driving experiment illustrates the potential of the approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal View of Time Series Imputation: Some Identification Results on Missing Mechanism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07180v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series imputation is one of the most challenge problems and has broad applications in various fields like health care and the Internet of Things. Existing methods mainly aim to model the temporally latent dependencies and the generation process from the observed time series data. In real-world scenarios, different types of missing mechanisms, like MAR (Missing At Random), and MNAR (Missing Not At Random) can occur in time series data. However, existing methods often overlook the difference among the aforementioned missing mechanisms and use a single model for time series imputation, which can easily lead to misleading results due to mechanism mismatching. In this paper, we propose a framework for time series imputation problem by exploring Different Missing Mechanisms (DMM in short) and tailoring solutions accordingly. Specifically, we first analyze the data generation processes with temporal latent states and missing cause variables for different mechanisms. Sequentially, we model these generation processes via variational inference and estimate prior distributions of latent variables via normalizing flow-based neural architecture. Furthermore, we establish identifiability results under the nonlinear independent component analysis framework to show that latent variables are identifiable. Experimental results show that our method surpasses existing time series imputation techniques across various datasets with different missing mechanisms, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using matrix-product states for time-series machine learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15826v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Matrix-product states (MPS) have proven to be a versatile ansatz for modeling quantum many-body physics. For many applications, and particularly in one-dimension, they capture relevant quantum correlations in many-body wavefunctions while remaining tractable to store and manipulate on a classical computer. This has motivated researchers to also apply the MPS ansatz to machine learning (ML) problems where capturing complex correlations in datasets is also a key requirement. Here, we develop and apply an MPS-based algorithm, MPSTime, for learning a joint probability distribution underlying an observed time-series dataset, and show how it can be used to tackle important time-series ML problems, including classification and imputation. MPSTime can efficiently learn complicated time-series probability distributions directly from data, requires only moderate maximum MPS bond dimension $\chi_{\rm max}$, with values for our applications ranging between $\chi_{\rm max} = 20-160$, and can be trained for both classification and imputation tasks under a single logarithmic loss function. Using synthetic and publicly available real-world datasets, spanning applications in medicine, energy, and astronomy, we demonstrate performance competitive with state-of-the-art ML approaches, but with the key advantage of encoding the full joint probability distribution learned from the data, which is useful for analyzing and interpreting its underlying structure. This manuscript is supplemented with the release of a publicly available code package MPSTime that implements our approach. The effectiveness of the MPS-based ansatz for capturing complex correlation structures in time-series data makes it a powerful foundation for tackling challenging time-series analysis problems across science, industry, and medicine.</p></details> | 31 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Flow Matching with Gaussian Process Priors for Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03024v2)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in generative modeling, particularly diffusion models, have opened new directions for time series modeling, achieving state-of-the-art performance in forecasting and synthesis. However, the reliance of diffusion-based models on a simple, fixed prior complicates the generative process since the data and prior distributions differ significantly. We introduce TSFlow, a conditional flow matching (CFM) model for time series combining Gaussian processes, optimal transport paths, and data-dependent prior distributions. By incorporating (conditional) Gaussian processes, TSFlow aligns the prior distribution more closely with the temporal structure of the data, enhancing both unconditional and conditional generation. Furthermore, we propose conditional prior sampling to enable probabilistic forecasting with an unconditionally trained model. In our experimental evaluation on eight real-world datasets, we demonstrate the generative capabilities of TSFlow, producing high-quality unconditional samples. Finally, we show that both conditionally and unconditionally trained models achieve competitive results across multiple forecasting benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wavelet Policy: Imitation Policy Learning in Frequency Domain with Wavelet Transforms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04991v2)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent imitation learning policies, often framed as time series prediction tasks, directly map robotic observations-such as high-dimensional visual data and proprioception-into the action space. While time series prediction primarily relies on spatial domain modeling, the underutilization of frequency domain analysis in robotic manipulation trajectory prediction may lead to neglecting the inherent temporal information embedded within action sequences. To address this, we reframe imitation learning policies through the lens of the frequency domain and introduce the Wavelet Policy. This novel approach employs wavelet transforms (WT) for feature preprocessing and extracts multi-scale features from the frequency domain using the SE2MD (Single Encoder to Multiple Decoder) architecture. Furthermore, to enhance feature mapping in the frequency domain and increase model capacity, we introduce a Learnable Frequency-Domain Filter (LFDF) after each frequency decoder, improving adaptability under different visual conditions. Our results show that the Wavelet Policy outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) end-to-end methods by over 10% on four challenging robotic arm tasks, while maintaining a comparable parameter count. In long-range settings, its performance declines more slowly as task volume increases. The source code is available at https://github.com/lurenjia384/Wavelet_Policy.</p></details> |  |
| **[NetSight: Graph Attention Based Traffic Forecasting in Computer Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07034v1)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The traffic in today's networks is increasingly influenced by the interactions among network nodes as well as by the temporal fluctuations in the demands of the nodes. Traditional statistical prediction methods are becoming obsolete due to their inability to address the non-linear and dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies present in today's network traffic. The most promising direction of research today is graph neural networks (GNNs) based prediction approaches that are naturally suited to handle graph-structured data. Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art GNN approaches separate the modeling of spatial and temporal information, resulting in the loss of important information about joint dependencies. These GNN based approaches further do not model information at both local and global scales simultaneously, leaving significant room for improvement. To address these challenges, we propose NetSight. NetSight learns joint spatio-temporal dependencies simultaneously at both global and local scales from the time-series of measurements of any given network metric collected at various nodes in a network. Using the learned information, NetSight can then accurately predict the future values of the given network metric at those nodes in the network. We propose several new concepts and techniques in the design of NetSight, such as spatio-temporal adjacency matrix and node normalization. Through extensive evaluations and comparison with prior approaches using data from two large real-world networks, we show that NetSight significantly outperforms all prior state-of-the-art approaches. We will release the source code and data used in the evaluation of NetSight on the acceptance of this paper.</p></details> |  |
| **[Marginalization Consistent Probabilistic Forecasting of Irregular Time Series via Mixture of Separable flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07246v2)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic forecasting models for joint distributions of targets in irregular time series with missing values are a heavily under-researched area in machine learning, with, to the best of our knowledge, only two Models have been researched so far: The Gaussian Process Regression model, and ProFITi. While ProFITi, thanks to using multivariate normalizing flows, is very expressive, leading to better predictive performance, it suffers from marginalization inconsistency: It does not guarantee that the marginal distributions of a subset of variables in its predictive distributions coincide with the directly predicted distributions of these variables. When asked to directly predict marginal distributions, they are often vastly inaccurate. We propose MOSES (Marginalization Consistent Mixture of Separable Flows), a model that parametrizes a stochastic process through a mixture of several latent multivariate Gaussian Processes combined with separable univariate Normalizing Flows. In particular, MOSES can be analytically marginalized, allowing it to directly answer a wider range of probabilistic queries than most competitors. Experiments on four datasets show that MOSES achieves both accurate joint and marginal predictions, surpassing all other marginalization consistent baselines, while only trailing slightly behind ProFITi in joint prediction, but vastly superior when predicting marginal distributions.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce a Transformer-based machine learning framework to infer time-dependent dissipation rates in quantum systems governed by the Lindblad master equation. Our approach uses time series of observable quantities, such as expectation values of single Pauli operators, as input to learn dissipation profiles without requiring knowledge of the initial quantum state or even the system Hamiltonian. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a hierarchy of open quantum models of increasing complexity, including single-qubit systems with time-independent or time-dependent jump rates, two-qubit interacting systems (e.g., Heisenberg and transverse Ising models), and the Jaynes--Cummings model involving light--matter interaction and cavity loss with time-dependent decay rates. Our method accurately reconstructs both fixed and time-dependent decay rates from observable time series. To support this, we prove that under reasonable assumptions, the jump rates in all these models are uniquely determined by a finite set of observables, such as qubit and photon measurements. In practice, we combine Transformer-based architectures with lightweight feature extraction techniques to efficiently learn these dynamics. Our results suggest that modern machine learning tools can serve as scalable and data-driven alternatives for identifying unknown environments in open quantum systems.</p></details> |  |

However, existing deep learning models are limited in processing non-stationary time series data because they cannot effectively capture the statistical characteristics that change over time. To address this problem, this paper proposes a new framework, AEFIN, which enhances the information sharing ability between stable and unstable components by introducing a cross-attention mechanism, and combines Fourier analysis networks with MLP to deeply explore the seasonal patterns and trend characteristics in unstable components. In addition, we design a new loss function that combines time-domain stability constraints, time-domain instability constraints, and frequency-domain stability constraints to improve the accuracy and robustness of forecasting. Experimental results show that AEFIN outperforms the most common models in terms of mean square error and mean absolute error, especially under non-stationary data conditions, and shows excellent forecasting capabilities. This paper provides an innovative solution for the modeling and forecasting of non-stationary time series data, and contributes to the research of deep learning for complex time series.</p></details> | IJCNN 2025 |

Due to the time-intensive nature of shapelet discovery, existing shapelet-based methods mainly focus on selecting discriminative shapes while discarding others to achieve candidate subsequence sparsification. However, this approach may exclude beneficial shapes and overlook the varying contributions of shapelets to classification performance. To this end, we propose a \textbf{Soft} sparse \textbf{Shape}s (\textbf{SoftShape}) model for efficient time series classification. Our approach mainly introduces soft shape sparsification and soft shape learning blocks. The former transforms shapes into soft representations based on classification contribution scores, merging lower-scored ones into a single shape to retain and differentiate all subsequence information. The latter facilitates intra- and inter-shape temporal pattern learning, improving model efficiency by using sparsified soft shapes as inputs. Specifically, we employ a learnable router to activate a subset of class-specific expert networks for intra-shape pattern learning. Meanwhile, a shared expert network learns inter-shape patterns by converting sparsified shapes into sequences. Extensive experiments show that SoftShape outperforms state-of-the-art methods and produces interpretable results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICML 2025</p></details> |

Among them, the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model remains a widely adopted linear technique due to its effectiveness in modeling temporal dependencies in economic, industrial, and social data. On the other hand, polynomial classifi-ers offer a robust framework for capturing non-linear relationships and have demonstrated competitive performance in domains such as stock price pre-diction. In this study, we propose a hybrid forecasting approach that inte-grates the ARIMA model with a polynomial classifier to leverage the com-plementary strengths of both models. The hybrid method is evaluated on multiple real-world time series datasets spanning diverse domains. Perfor-mance is assessed based on forecasting accuracy and computational effi-ciency. Experimental results reveal that the proposed hybrid model consist-ently outperforms the individual models in terms of prediction accuracy, al-beit with a modest increase in execution time.</p></details> |  |

We introduce NewsNet-SDF, a novel deep learning framework that seamlessly integrates pretrained language model embeddings with financial time series through adversarial networks. Our multimodal architecture processes financial news using GTE-multilingual models, extracts temporal patterns from macroeconomic data via LSTM networks, and normalizes firm characteristics, fusing these heterogeneous information sources through an innovative adversarial training mechanism. Our dataset encompasses approximately 2.5 million news articles and 10,000 unique securities, addressing the computational challenges of processing and aligning text data with financial time series. Empirical evaluations on U.S. equity data (1980-2022) demonstrate NewsNet-SDF substantially outperforms alternatives with a Sharpe ratio of 2.80. The model shows a 471% improvement over CAPM, over 200% improvement versus traditional SDF implementations, and a 74% reduction in pricing errors compared to the Fama-French five-factor model. In comprehensive comparisons, our deep learning approach consistently outperforms traditional, modern, and other neural asset pricing models across all key metrics. Ablation studies confirm that text embeddings contribute significantly more to model performance than macroeconomic features, with news-derived principal components ranking among the most influential determinants of SDF dynamics.

| **[Quantum Observers: A NISQ Hardware Demonstration of Chaotic State Prediction Using Quantum Echo-state Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06799v1)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in artificial intelligence have highlighted the remarkable capabilities of neural network (NN)-powered systems on classical computers. However, these systems face significant computational challenges that limit scalability and efficiency. Quantum computers hold the potential to overcome these limitations and increase processing power beyond classical systems. Despite this, integrating quantum computing with NNs remains largely unrealized due to challenges posed by noise, decoherence, and high error rates in current quantum hardware. Here, we propose a novel quantum echo-state network (QESN) design and implementation algorithm that can operate within the presence of noise on current IBM hardware. We apply classical control-theoretic response analysis to characterize the QESN, emphasizing its rich nonlinear dynamics and memory, as well as its ability to be fine-tuned with sparsity and re-uploading blocks. We validate our approach through a comprehensive demonstration of QESNs functioning as quantum observers, applied in both high-fidelity simulations and hardware experiments utilizing data from a prototypical chaotic Lorenz system. Our results show that the QESN can predict long time-series with persistent memory, running over 100 times longer than the median T}1 and T2 of the IBM Marrakesh QPU, achieving state-of-the-art time-series performance on superconducting hardware.</p></details> | 14 pages, 12 figures |

However, for most reconstruction-based approaches, detecting anomalies remains a challenge due to the complexity of sequential patterns in time series data. On the one hand, reconstruction-based techniques are susceptible to computational deviation stemming from anomalies, which can lead to impure representations of normal sequence patterns. On the other hand, they often focus on the time-domain dependencies of time series, while ignoring the alignment of frequency information beyond the time domain. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Frequency-augmented Convolutional Transformer (FreCT). FreCT utilizes patch operations to generate contrastive views and employs an improved Transformer architecture integrated with a convolution module to capture long-term dependencies while preserving local topology information. The introduced frequency analysis based on Fourier transformation could enhance the model's ability to capture crucial characteristics beyond the time domain. To protect the training quality from anomalies and improve the robustness, FreCT deploys stop-gradient Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and absolute error to optimize consistency information in both time and frequency domains. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that FreCT outperforms existing methods in identifying anomalies.</p></details> |  |

Yet, our understanding of the reasons for their effectiveness remains limited. In this work, we propose a novel pruning strategy, $\textbf{R}$eplace $\textbf{A}$ttention with $\textbf{M}$LP (RAM), that approximates the attention mechanism using only feedforward layers, residual connections, and layer normalization for temporal and/or spatial modeling in multivariate time series forecasting. Specifically, the Q, K, and V projections, the attention score calculation, the dot-product between the attention score and the V, and the final projection can be removed from the attention-based networks without significantly degrading the performance, so that the given network remains the top-tier compared to other SOTA methods. RAM achieves a $62.579\%$ reduction in FLOPs for spatio-temporal models with less than $2.5\%$ performance drop, and a $42.233\%$ FLOPs reduction for LTSF models with less than $2\%$ performance drop.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we investigate their utility in modeling classical dynamical systems -- specifically, a noisy predator-prey (Lotka-Volterra) system. We train a simple linear attention model on perturbed time-series data to reconstruct system trajectories. Remarkably, the learned attention weights align with the geometric structure of the Lyapunov function: high attention corresponds to flat regions (where perturbations have small effect), and low attention aligns with steep regions (where perturbations have large effect). We further demonstrate that attention-based weighting can serve as a proxy for sensitivity analysis, capturing key phase-space properties without explicit knowledge of the system equations. These results suggest a novel use of AI-derived attention for interpretable, data-driven analysis and control of nonlinear systems. For example our framework could support future work in biological modeling of circadian rhythms, and interpretable machine learning for dynamical environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 fig...</summary><p>5 figures, 12 pages, python code included</p></details> |

The proposed strategy is motivated by data from the Human Epilepsy Project (HEP), which collects seizure occurrence data for epilepsy patients, together with relevant covariates. The model is designed to flexibly accommodate the particular challenges that arise with such data. First, epilepsy data require models that can allow for extensive heterogeneity, across both patients and time. With this regard, state space models offer a flexible, yet still analytically amenable class of models. Nevertheless, seizure time-series might share similar behavioral patterns, such as local prolonged periods of elevated seizure presence, which we refer to as "clumping". Such similarities can be used to share strength across patients and define subgroups. However, due to the lack of alignment, straightforward hierarchical modeling of latent state space parameters is not practicable. To overcome this constraint, we construct a strategy that preserves the flexibility of individual trajectories while also exploiting similarities across individuals to borrow information through a nonparametric prior. On the one hand, heterogeneity is ensured by (almost) subject-specific state-space submodels. On the other, borrowing of information is obtained by introducing a Pitman-Yor prior on group-specific probabilities for patterns of clinical interest. We design a posterior sampling strategy that leverages recent developments of binary state space models using the Unified Skewed Normal family (SUN). The model, which allows the sharing of information across individuals with similar disease traits over time, can more generally be adapted to any setting characterized by unaligned binary longitudinal data.</p></details> |  |

This is due to the physical significance of the electrochemical model, which is complemented by a machine learning model that compensates for output prediction errors caused by system uncertainties. While hybrid models have demonstrated robust output prediction performance under large system uncertainties, they are highly susceptible to the influence of uncertainties during parameter identification, which can compromise the physical significance of the model. To address this challenge, we present a parameter estimation framework that explicitly considers system uncertainties through a discrepancy function. The approach also incorporates a downsampling procedure to address the computational barriers associated with large time-series data sets, as are typical in the battery domain. The framework was validated in simulation, yielding several mean parameter estimation errors that were one order of magnitude smaller than those of the conventional least squares approach. While developed for the high-uncertainty, electrochemical hybrid modeling context, the estimation framework is applicable to all models and is presented in a generalized form.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, to be published in the 2025 American Control Conference proceedings</p></details> |

In this paper, we present a novel method that leverages causal dynamics to achieve effective fMRI-based subject and task fingerprinting. Methods: By applying an implicit-explicit discretization scheme, we develop a two-timescale linear state-space model. Through data-driven identification of its parameters, the model captures causal signatures, including directed interactions among brain regions from a spatial perspective, and disentangled fast and slow dynamic modes of brain activity from a temporal perspective. These causal signatures are then integrated with: (i) a modal decomposition and projection method for model-based subject identification, and (ii) a Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for learning-based task classification. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of the brain reachability landscape as a novel visualization tool, which quantitatively characterizes the maximum possible activation levels of brain regions under various fMRI tasks. Results: We evaluate the proposed approach using the Human Connectome Project dataset and demonstrate its advantage over non-causality-based methods. The obtained causal signatures are visualized and demonstrate clear biological relevance with established understandings of brain function. Conclusion: We verified the feasibility and effectiveness of utilizing brain causal signatures for subject and task fingerprinting. Additionally, our work paves the way for further studies on causal fingerprints with potential applications in both healthy controls and neurodegenerative diseases.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, challenges emerge when using promising images or environmental context masks to extract various factors for time-series network modeling, causing pre-processing errors or a loss of efficiency. Typically, pedestrian positions captured by onboard cameras are often distorted and do not accurately reflect their actual movements. To address these issues, GTransPDM -- a Graph-embedded Transformer with a Position Decoupling Module -- was developed for pedestrian crossing intention prediction by leveraging multi-modal features. First, a positional decoupling module was proposed to decompose pedestrian lateral motion and encode depth cues in the image view. Then, a graph-embedded Transformer was designed to capture the spatio-temporal dynamics of human pose skeletons, integrating essential factors such as position, skeleton, and ego-vehicle motion. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves 92% accuracy on the PIE dataset and 87% accuracy on the JAAD dataset, with a processing speed of 0.05ms. It outperforms the state-of-the-art in comparison.</p></details> | IEEE SPL |

Addressing the challenge of training with noise, a prevalent issue in practical anomaly detection, is frequently overlooked. In a pioneering endeavor, this study delves into the realm of label-level noise within sensory time-series anomaly detection (TSAD). This paper presents a novel and practical end-to-end unsupervised TSAD when the training data is contaminated with anomalies. The introduced approach, called TSAD-C, is devoid of access to abnormality labels during the training phase. TSAD-C encompasses three core modules: a Decontaminator to rectify anomalies (aka noise) present during training, a Long-range Variable Dependency Modeling module to capture long-term intra- and inter-variable dependencies within the decontaminated data that is considered as a surrogate of the pure normal data, and an Anomaly Scoring module to detect anomalies from all types. Our extensive experiments conducted on four reliable and diverse datasets conclusively demonstrate that TSAD-C surpasses existing methodologies, thus establishing a new state-of-the-art in the TSAD field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI 2025)</p></details> |

Conventional single-modality methods fail to capture the intricate relationships required for precise anomaly prediction in complex predictive environments with abundant data and multiple modalities. This paper proposes a neurosymbolic AI and fusion-based approach for multimodal anomaly prediction in assembly pipelines. We introduce a time series and image-based fusion model that leverages decision-level fusion techniques. Our research builds upon three primary novel approaches in multimodal learning: time series and image-based decision-level fusion modeling, transfer learning for fusion, and knowledge-infused learning. We evaluate the novel method using our derived and publicly available multimodal dataset and conduct comprehensive ablation studies to assess the impact of our preprocessing techniques and fusion model compared to traditional baselines. The results demonstrate that a neurosymbolic AI-based fusion approach that uses transfer learning can effectively harness the complementary strengths of time series and image data, offering a robust and interpretable approach for anomaly prediction in assembly pipelines with enhanced performance. \noindent The datasets, codes to reproduce the results, supplementary materials, and demo are available at https://github.com/ChathurangiShyalika/NSF-MAP.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables, IJCAI 2025 (International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence) Special Track on AI4Tech: AI Enabling Critical Technologies</p></details> |
| **[Gateformer: Advancing Multivariate Time Series Forecasting through Temporal and Variate-Wise Attention with Gated Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00307v2)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been a recent surge of interest in time series modeling using the Transformer architecture. However, forecasting multivariate time series with Transformer presents a unique challenge as it requires modeling both temporal (cross-time) and variate (cross-variate) dependencies. While Transformer-based models have gained popularity for their flexibility in capturing both sequential and cross-variate relationships, it is unclear how to best integrate these two sources of information in the context of the Transformer architecture while optimizing for both performance and efficiency. We re-purpose the Transformer architecture to effectively model both cross-time and cross-variate dependencies. Our approach begins by embedding each variate independently into a variate-wise representation that captures its cross-time dynamics, and then models cross-variate dependencies through attention mechanisms on these learned embeddings. Gating operations in both cross-time and cross-variate modeling phases regulate information flow, allowing the model to focus on the most relevant features for accurate predictions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across 13 real-world datasets and can be seamlessly integrated into other Transformer-based and LLM-based forecasters, delivering performance improvements up to 20.7\% over original models.

While deep learning has advanced NILM, it remains limited by its dependence on labeled data, restricted generalization, and lack of interpretability. In this paper, we introduce the first prompt-based NILM framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) with in-context learning. We design and evaluate prompt strategies that integrate appliance features, timestamps and contextual information, as well as representative time-series examples, using the REDD dataset. With optimized prompts, LLMs achieve competitive state detection accuracy, reaching an average F1-score of 0.676 on unseen households, and demonstrate robust generalization without the need for fine-tuning. LLMs also enhance interpretability by providing clear, human-readable explanations for their predictions. Our results show that LLMs can reduce data requirements, improve adaptability, and provide transparent energy disaggregation in NILM applications.</p></details> |  |

In particular, time series classification plays an indispensable role in segmenting different phases in stock markets, predicting customer behavior, and classifying worker actions and engagement levels. These aspects contribute significantly to the advancement of automated decision-making and system optimization in real-world applications. However, there is a large consensus that time series data often suffers from domain shifts between training and test sets, which dramatically degrades the classification performance. Despite the success of (reversible) instance normalization in handling the domain shifts for time series regression tasks, its performance in classification is unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose \textit{FIC-TSC}, a training framework for time series classification that leverages Fisher information as the constraint. We theoretically and empirically show this is an efficient and effective solution to guide the model converge toward flatter minima, which enhances its generalizability to distribution shifts. We rigorously evaluate our method on 30 UEA multivariate and 85 UCR univariate datasets. Our empirical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over 14 recent state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML2025.

| **[Structure-preserving contrastive learning for spatial time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06380v3)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The effectiveness of neural network models largely relies on learning meaningful latent patterns from data, where self-supervised learning of informative representations can enhance model performance and generalisability. However, self-supervised representation learning for spatially characterised time series, which are ubiquitous in transportation domain, poses unique challenges due to the necessity of maintaining fine-grained spatio-temporal similarities in the latent space. In this study, we introduce two structure-preserving regularisers for the contrastive learning of spatial time series: one regulariser preserves the topology of similarities between instances, and the other preserves the graph geometry of similarities across spatial and temporal dimensions. To balance the contrastive learning objective and the need for structure preservation, we propose a dynamic weighting mechanism that adaptively manages this trade-off and stabilises training. We validate the proposed method through extensive experiments, including multivariate time series classification to demonstrate its general applicability, as well as macroscopic and microscopic traffic prediction to highlight its particular usefulness in encoding traffic interactions. Across all tasks, our method preserves the similarity structures more effectively and improves state-of-the-art task performances. This method can be integrated with an arbitrary neural network model and is particularly beneficial for time series data with spatial or geographical features. Furthermore, our findings suggest that well-preserved similarity structures in the latent space indicate more informative and useful representations. This provides insights to design more effective neural networks for data-driven transportation research.

| **[IRNN: Innovation-driven Recurrent Neural Network for Time-Series Data Modeling and Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05916v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world datasets are time series that are sequentially collected and contain rich temporal information. Thus, a common interest in practice is to capture dynamics of time series and predict their future evolutions. To this end, the recurrent neural network (RNN) has been a prevalent and effective machine learning option, which admits a nonlinear state-space model representation. Motivated by the resemblance between RNN and Kalman filter (KF) for linear state-space models, we propose in this paper Innovation-driven RNN (IRNN), a novel RNN architecture tailored to time-series data modeling and prediction tasks. By adapting the concept of "innovation" from KF to RNN, past prediction errors are adopted as additional input signals to update hidden states of RNN and boost prediction performance. Since innovation data depend on network parameters, existing training algorithms for RNN do not apply to IRNN straightforwardly. Thus, a tailored training algorithm dubbed input updating-based back-propagation through time (IU-BPTT) is further proposed, which alternates between updating innovations and optimizing network parameters via gradient descent. Experiments on real-world benchmark datasets show that the integration of innovations into various forms of RNN leads to remarkably improved prediction accuracy of IRNN without increasing the training cost substantially.</p></details> |  |
| **[GDformer: Going Beyond Subsequence Isolation for Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18196v2)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised anomaly detection of multivariate time series is a challenging task, given the requirements of deriving a compact detection criterion without accessing the anomaly points. The existing methods are mainly based on reconstruction error or association divergence, which are both confined to isolated subsequences with limited horizons, hardly promising unified series-level criterion. In this paper, we propose the Global Dictionary-enhanced Transformer (GDformer) with a renovated dictionary-based cross attention mechanism to cultivate the global representations shared by all normal points in the entire series. Accordingly, the cross-attention maps reflect the correlation weights between the point and global representations, which naturally leads to the representation-wise similarity-based detection criterion. To foster more compact detection boundary, prototypes are introduced to capture the distribution of normal point-global correlation weights. GDformer consistently achieves state-of-the-art unsupervised anomaly detection performance on five real-world benchmark datasets. Further experiments validate the global dictionary has great transferability among various datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/yuppielqx/GDformer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised Multi-modal Feature Alignment for Time Series Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05698v2)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent times, the field of unsupervised representation learning (URL) for time series data has garnered significant interest due to its remarkable adaptability across diverse downstream applications. Unsupervised learning goals differ from downstream tasks, making it tricky to ensure downstream task utility by focusing only on temporal feature characterization. Researchers have proposed multiple transformations to extract discriminative patterns implied in informative time series, trying to fill the gap. Despite the introduction of a variety of feature engineering techniques, e.g. spectral domain, wavelet transformed features, features in image form and symbolic features etc. the utilization of intricate feature fusion methods and dependence on heterogeneous features during inference hampers the scalability of the solutions. To address this, our study introduces an innovative approach that focuses on aligning and binding time series representations encoded from different modalities, inspired by spectral graph theory, thereby guiding the neural encoder to uncover latent pattern associations among these multi-modal features. In contrast to conventional methods that fuse features from multiple modalities, our proposed approach simplifies the neural architecture by retaining a single time series encoder, consequently leading to preserved scalability. We further demonstrate and prove mechanisms for the encoder to maintain better inductive bias. In our experimental evaluation, we validated the proposed method on a diverse set of time series datasets from various domains. Our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art URL methods across diverse downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |

| **[Accurate and Efficient Multivariate Time Series Forecasting via Offline Clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05738v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and efficient multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting is essential for applications such as traffic management and weather prediction, which depend on capturing long-range temporal dependencies and interactions between entities. Existing methods, particularly those based on Transformer architectures, compute pairwise dependencies across all time steps, leading to a computational complexity that scales quadratically with the length of the input. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the Forecaster with Offline Clustering Using Segments (FOCUS), a novel approach to MTS forecasting that simplifies long-range dependency modeling through the use of prototypes extracted via offline clustering. These prototypes encapsulate high-level events in the real-world system underlying the data, summarizing the key characteristics of similar time segments. In the online phase, FOCUS dynamically adapts these patterns to the current input and captures dependencies between the input segment and high-level events, enabling both accurate and efficient forecasting. By identifying prototypes during the offline clustering phase, FOCUS reduces the computational complexity of modeling long-range dependencies in the online phase to linear scaling. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that FOCUS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs.</p></details> |  |

Dissimilarity-based approaches, such as Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), are classical methods for distinguishing time series when time deformations are confounding information.

We show that, under theoretically ideal conditions, a continuous version of classic 1NN-DTW method can solve the stated problem, even when only one training sample is available. In addition, we propose an alternative dissimilarity measure based on Optimal Transport and show that it can also solve the aforementioned problem statement at a significantly reduced computational cost. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the newly proposed approach in simulated and real time series classification data, showing the efficacy of the method.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving accurate vehicular channel prediction is challenging due to significant Doppler effects and rapid channel variations resulting from high-speed vehicle movement and complex propagation environments. In this paper, we propose a novel delay-Doppler (DD) domain channel prediction framework tailored for high-mobility vehicular networks. By transforming the channel representation into the DD domain, we obtain an intuitive, sparse, and stable depiction that closely aligns with the underlying physical propagation processes, effectively reducing the complex vehicular channel to a set of time-series parameters with enhanced predictability. Furthermore, we leverage the large artificial intelligence (AI) model to predict these DD-domain time-series parameters, capitalizing on their advanced ability to model temporal correlations. The zero-shot capability of the pre-trained large AI model facilitates accurate channel predictions without requiring task-specific training, while subsequent fine-tuning on specific vehicular channel data further improves prediction accuracy. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our DD-domain channel prediction framework and the superior accuracy of the large AI model in predicting time-series channel parameters, thereby highlighting the potential of our approach for robust vehicular communication systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been accepted by SCIENCE CHINA Information Sciences</p></details> |

However, they still lack a dedicated and efficient training algorithm. The popular backpropagation with surrogate gradients, adapted from stochastic gradient descent (SGD)-derived algorithms, has several drawbacks when used as an optimizer for SNNs. Specifically, it suffers from low scalability and numerical imprecision. In this paper, we propose a novel SNN training method based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Our ADMM-based training aims to solve the problem of the SNN step function's non-differentiability. We formulate the problem, derive closed-form updates, and empirically show the optimizer's convergence properties, great potential, and possible new research directions to improve the method in a simulated proof-of-concept.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures.

| **[On robustness of Spectral Rényi divergence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06902v3)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies a specific category of statistical divergences for spectral densities of time series: the spectral $\alpha$-R\'{e}nyi divergences, which includes the Itakura--Saito divergence as a subset. The aim of this paper is to highlight both information-theoretic and statistical properties of spectral $\alpha$-R\'{e}nyi divergences. We reveal the connection between the spectral $\alpha$-R\'{e}nyi divergence and the $\gamma$-divergence in robust statistics, and a variational representation of spectral $\alpha$-R\'{e}nyi divergence. Inspired by these results suggesting ``robustness'' of spectral $\alpha$-R\'{e}nyi divergence, we show that the minimum spectral R\'{e}nyi divergence estimate has a stable optimization path with respect to outliers in the frequency domain, unlike the minimum Itakura-Saito divergence estimator, and thus it delivers more stable estimate, reducing the need for intricate pre-processing.</p></details> |  |
