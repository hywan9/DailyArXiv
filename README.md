| **[The broader spectrum of in-context learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03782v3)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability of language models to learn a task from a few examples in context has generated substantial interest. Here, we provide a perspective that situates this type of supervised few-shot learning within a much broader spectrum of meta-learned in-context learning. Indeed, we suggest that any distribution of sequences in which context non-trivially decreases loss on subsequent predictions can be interpreted as eliciting a kind of in-context learning. We suggest that this perspective helps to unify the broad set of in-context abilities that language models exhibit -- such as adapting to tasks from instructions or role play, or extrapolating time series. This perspective also sheds light on potential roots of in-context learning in lower-level processing of linguistic dependencies (e.g. coreference or parallel structures). Finally, taking this perspective highlights the importance of generalization, which we suggest can be studied along several dimensions: not only the ability to learn something novel, but also flexibility in learning from different presentations, and in applying what is learned. We discuss broader connections to past literature in meta-learning and goal-conditioned agents, and other perspectives on learning and adaptation. We close by suggesting that research on in-context learning should consider this broader spectrum of in-context capabilities and types of generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Beyond Experience: Generalizing to Unseen State Space with Reservoir Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05292v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning techniques offer an effective approach to modeling dynamical systems solely from observed data. However, without explicit structural priors -- built-in assumptions about the underlying dynamics -- these techniques typically struggle to generalize to aspects of the dynamics that are poorly represented in the training data. Here, we demonstrate that reservoir computing -- a simple, efficient, and versatile machine learning framework often used for data-driven modeling of dynamical systems -- can generalize to unexplored regions of state space without explicit structural priors. First, we describe a multiple-trajectory training scheme for reservoir computers that supports training across a collection of disjoint time series, enabling effective use of available training data. Then, applying this training scheme to multistable dynamical systems, we show that RCs trained on trajectories from a single basin of attraction can achieve out-of-domain generalization by capturing system behavior in entirely unobserved basins.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |

Diffusion-Driven Approach with Multi-Grained Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05276v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in time series generation have shown promise, yet controlling properties in generated sequences remains challenging. Time Series Editing (TSE) - making precise modifications while preserving temporal coherence - consider both point-level constraints and segment-level controls that current methods struggle to provide. We introduce the CocktailEdit framework to enable simultaneous, flexible control across different types of constraints. This framework combines two key mechanisms: a confidence-weighted anchor control for point-wise constraints and a classifier-based control for managing statistical properties such as sums and averages over segments. Our methods achieve precise local control during the denoising inference stage while maintaining temporal coherence and integrating seamlessly, with any conditionally trained diffusion-based time series models. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and models demonstrate its effectiveness. Our work bridges the gap between pure generative modeling and real-world time series editing needs, offering a flexible solution for human-in-the-loop time series generation and editing. The code and demo are provided for validation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context is Key: A Benchmark for Forecasting with Essential Textual Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18959v4)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting is a critical task in decision-making across numerous domains. While historical numerical data provide a start, they fail to convey the complete context for reliable and accurate predictions. Human forecasters frequently rely on additional information, such as background knowledge and constraints, which can efficiently be communicated through natural language. However, in spite of recent progress with LLM-based forecasters, their ability to effectively integrate this textual information remains an open question. To address this, we introduce "Context is Key" (CiK), a time-series forecasting benchmark that pairs numerical data with diverse types of carefully crafted textual context, requiring models to integrate both modalities; crucially, every task in CiK requires understanding textual context to be solved successfully. We evaluate a range of approaches, including statistical models, time series foundation models, and LLM-based forecasters, and propose a simple yet effective LLM prompting method that outperforms all other tested methods on our benchmark. Our experiments highlight the importance of incorporating contextual information, demonstrate surprising performance when using LLM-based forecasting models, and also reveal some of their critical shortcomings. This benchmark aims to advance multimodal forecasting by promoting models that are both accurate and accessible to decision-makers with varied technical expertise. The benchmark can be visualized at https://servicenow.github.io/context-is-key-forecasting/v0/.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025.

| **[Learning long range dependencies through time reversal symmetry breaking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05259v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep State Space Models (SSMs) reignite physics-grounded compute paradigms, as RNNs could natively be embodied into dynamical systems. This calls for dedicated learning algorithms obeying to core physical principles, with efficient techniques to simulate these systems and guide their design. We propose Recurrent Hamiltonian Echo Learning (RHEL), an algorithm which provably computes loss gradients as finite differences of physical trajectories of non-dissipative, Hamiltonian systems. In ML terms, RHEL only requires three "forward passes" irrespective of model size, without explicit Jacobian computation, nor incurring any variance in the gradient estimation. Motivated by the physical realization of our algorithm, we first introduce RHEL in continuous time and demonstrate its formal equivalence with the continuous adjoint state method. To facilitate the simulation of Hamiltonian systems trained by RHEL, we propose a discrete-time version of RHEL which is equivalent to Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) when applied to a class of recurrent modules which we call Hamiltonian Recurrent Units (HRUs). This setting allows us to demonstrate the scalability of RHEL by generalizing these results to hierarchies of HRUs, which we call Hamiltonian SSMs (HSSMs). We apply RHEL to train HSSMs with linear and nonlinear dynamics on a variety of time-series tasks ranging from mid-range to long-range classification and regression with sequence length reaching $\sim 50k$. We show that RHEL consistently matches the performance of BPTT across all models and tasks. This work opens new doors for the design of scalable, energy-efficient physical systems endowed with self-learning capabilities for sequence modelling.</p></details> | 45 pages |
| **[Robust Moment Identification for Nonlinear PDEs via a Neural ODE Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05245v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a data-driven framework for learning reduced-order moment dynamics from PDE-governed systems using Neural ODEs. In contrast to derivative-based methods like SINDy, which necessitate densely sampled data and are sensitive to noise, our approach based on Neural ODEs directly models moment trajectories, enabling robust learning from sparse and potentially irregular time series. Using as an application platform the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation, the framework accurately recovers governing moment dynamics when closure is available, even with limited and irregular observations. For systems without analytical closure, we introduce a data-driven coordinate transformation strategy based on Stiefel manifold optimization, enabling the discovery of low-dimensional representations in which the moment dynamics become closed, facilitating interpretable and reliable modeling. We also explore cases where a closure model is not known, such as a Fisher-KPP reaction-diffusion system. Here we demonstrate that Neural ODEs can still effectively approximate the unclosed moment dynamics and achieve superior extrapolation accuracy compared to physical-expert-derived ODE models. This advantage remains robust even under sparse and irregular sampling, highlighting the method's robustness in data-limited settings. Our results highlight the Neural ODE framework as a powerful and flexible tool for learning interpretable, low-dimensional moment dynamics in complex PDE-governed systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Timing is Important: Risk-aware Fund Allocation based on Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24835v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fund allocation has been an increasingly important problem in the financial domain. In reality, we aim to allocate the funds to buy certain assets within a certain future period. Naive solutions such as prediction-only or Predict-then-Optimize approaches suffer from goal mismatch. Additionally, the introduction of the SOTA time series forecasting model inevitably introduces additional uncertainty in the predicted result. To solve both problems mentioned above, we introduce a Risk-aware Time-Series Predict-and-Allocate (RTS-PnO) framework, which holds no prior assumption on the forecasting models. Such a framework contains three features: (i) end-to-end training with objective alignment measurement, (ii) adaptive forecasting uncertainty calibration, and (iii) agnostic towards forecasting models. The evaluation of RTS-PnO is conducted over both online and offline experiments. For offline experiments, eight datasets from three categories of financial applications are used: Currency, Stock, and Cryptos. RTS-PnO consistently outperforms other competitive baselines. The online experiment is conducted on the Cross-Border Payment business at FiT, Tencent, and an 8.4\% decrease in regret is witnessed when compared with the product-line approach. The code for the offline experiment is available at https://github.com/fuyuanlyu/RTS-PnO.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD 2025 ADS Track</p></details> |
| **[Causal Discovery from Conditionally Stationary Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06257v4)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal discovery, i.e., inferring underlying causal relationships from observational data, is highly challenging for AI systems. In a time series modeling context, traditional causal discovery methods mainly consider constrained scenarios with fully observed variables and/or data from stationary time-series. We develop a causal discovery approach to handle a wide class of nonstationary time series that are conditionally stationary, where the nonstationary behaviour is modeled as stationarity conditioned on a set of latent state variables. Named State-Dependent Causal Inference (SDCI), our approach is able to recover the underlying causal dependencies, with provable identifiablity for the state-dependent causal structures. Empirical experiments on nonlinear particle interaction data and gene regulatory networks demonstrate SDCI's superior performance over baseline causal discovery methods. Improved results over non-causal RNNs on modeling NBA player movements demonstrate the potential of our method and motivate the use of causality-driven methods for forecasting.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Unleashing The Power of Pre-Trained Language Models for Irregularly Sampled Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08328v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), such as ChatGPT, have significantly advanced the field of natural language processing. This progress has inspired a series of innovative studies that explore the adaptation of PLMs to time series analysis, intending to create a unified foundation model that addresses various time series analytical tasks. However, these efforts predominantly focus on Regularly Sampled Time Series (RSTS), neglecting the unique challenges posed by Irregularly Sampled Time Series (ISTS), which are characterized by uneven sampling intervals and prevalent missing data. To bridge this gap, this work takes the first step in exploring the potential of PLMs for ISTS analysis. We begin by investigating the effect of various methods for representing ISTS, aiming to maximize the efficacy of PLMs in the analysis. Furthermore, we propose a unified PLM-based framework, named ISTS-PLM, to address diverse ISTS analytical tasks. It integrates novel time-aware and variable-aware PLMs tailored to tackle the intractable intra- and inter-time series modeling in ISTS. Finally, extensive experiments on a comprehensive benchmark demonstrate that the ISTS-PLM, utilizing a structured and effective series-based representation for ISTS, consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across various analytical tasks, such as classification, interpolation, extrapolation, few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios, spanning scientific domains like healthcare, biomechanics, and climate science.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD'25 |
| **[Goal-Oriented Time-Series Forecasting: Foundation Framework Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17493v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional time-series forecasting often focuses only on minimizing prediction errors, ignoring the specific requirements of real-world applications that employ them. This paper presents a new training methodology, which allows a forecasting model to dynamically adjust its focus based on the importance of forecast ranges specified by the end application. Unlike previous methods that fix these ranges beforehand, our training approach breaks down predictions over the entire signal range into smaller segments, which are then dynamically weighted and combined to produce accurate forecasts within a region of interest. We tested our method on standard datasets, including a new wireless communication dataset, and found that not only it improves prediction accuracy but also enhances the performance of end application employing the forecasting model. This research provides a basis for creating forecasting systems that better connect prediction and decision-making in various practical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[At the edge of Donsker's Theorem: Asymptotics of multiscale scan statistics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05112v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For nonparametric inference about a function, multiscale testing procedures resolve the need for bandwidth selection and achieve asymptotically optimal detection performance against a broad range of alternatives. However, critical values strongly depend on the noise distribution, and we argue that existing methods are either statistically infeasible, or asymptotically sub-optimal. To address this methodological challenge, we show how to develop a feasible multiscale test via weak convergence arguments, by replacing the additive multiscale penalty with a multiplicative weighting. This new theoretical foundation preserves the optimal detection properties of multiscale tests and extends their applicability to nonstationary nonlinear time series via a tailored bootstrap scheme. Inference for signal discovery, goodness-of-fit testing of regression functions, and multiple changepoint detection is studied in detail, and we apply the new methodology to analyze the April 2025 power blackout on the Iberian peninsula. Our methodology is enabled by a novel functional central limit in H\"older spaces with critical modulus of continuity, where Donsker's theorem fails to hold due to lack of tightness. Probabilistically, we discover a novel form of thresholded weak convergence that holds only in the upper support of the distribution.</p></details> | 41 pages, 4 figures |
| **[TIMING: Temporality-Aware Integrated Gradients for Time Series Explanation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05035v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods for time series primarily estimate point-wise attribution magnitudes, while overlooking the directional impact on predictions, leading to suboptimal identification of significant points. Our analysis shows that conventional Integrated Gradients (IG) effectively capture critical points with both positive and negative impacts on predictions. However, current evaluation metrics fail to assess this capability, as they inadvertently cancel out opposing feature contributions. To address this limitation, we propose novel evaluation metrics-Cumulative Prediction Difference (CPD) and Cumulative Prediction Preservation (CPP)-to systematically assess whether attribution methods accurately identify significant positive and negative points in time series XAI. Under these metrics, conventional IG outperforms recent counterparts. However, directly applying IG to time series data may lead to suboptimal outcomes, as generated paths ignore temporal relationships and introduce out-of-distribution samples. To overcome these challenges, we introduce TIMING, which enhances IG by incorporating temporal awareness while maintaining its theoretical properties. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world time series benchmarks demonstrate that TIMING outperforms existing time series XAI baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/drumpt/TIMING.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 Spotlight Presentation; Code is available at https://github.com/drumpt/TIMING</p></details> |
| **[FinMultiTime: A Four-Modal Bilingual Dataset for Financial Time-Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05019v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pure time series forecasting tasks typically focus exclusively on numerical features; however, real-world financial decision-making demands the comparison and analysis of heterogeneous sources of information. Recent advances in deep learning and large scale language models (LLMs) have made significant strides in capturing sentiment and other qualitative signals, thereby enhancing the accuracy of financial time series predictions. Despite these advances, most existing datasets consist solely of price series and news text, are confined to a single market, and remain limited in scale. In this paper, we introduce FinMultiTime, the first large scale, multimodal financial time series dataset. FinMultiTime temporally aligns four distinct modalities financial news, structured financial tables, K-line technical charts, and stock price time series across both the S&P 500 and HS 300 universes. Covering 5,105 stocks from 2009 to 2025 in the United States and China, the dataset totals 112.6 GB and provides minute-level, daily, and quarterly resolutions, thus capturing short, medium, and long term market signals with high fidelity. Our experiments demonstrate that (1) scale and data quality markedly boost prediction accuracy; (2) multimodal fusion yields moderate gains in Transformer models; and (3) a fully reproducible pipeline enables seamless dataset updates.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Efficient Time Series Processing for Transformers and State-Space Models through Token Merging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17951v3)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances in subquadratic attention mechanisms or state-space models, processing long token sequences still imposes significant computational requirements. Token merging has emerged as a solution to increase computational efficiency in computer vision architectures. In this work, we perform the first investigations of token merging in time series analysis on both transformers and state-space models. We further introduce local merging, a domain-specific token merging algorithm that selectively combines tokens within a local neighborhood, achieving two major benefits: a) Local merging can adjust its computational complexity from quadratic to linear based on the neighborhood size to effectively scale to long sequences; b) Local merging is the first causal merging scheme enabling token merging in transformer decoders. Further, we identify spectral properties of the input data that reliably predict the potential benefits of local merging without requiring evaluation on downstream tasks. Our comprehensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that local merging offers substantial efficiency gains with minimal impact on accuracy, achieving up to 5400% acceleration on the recently proposed Chronos foundation model.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages in total, 20 figures</p></details> |
| **[Distribution System State and Impedance Estimation Augmented with Carson's Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04949v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The impedances of cables and lines used in (multi-conductor) distribution networks are usually unknown or approximated, and may lead to problematic results for any physics-based power system calculation, e.g., (optimal) power flow. Learning parameters from time series data is one of the few available options to obtain improved impedance models. This paper presents an approach that combines statistical learning concepts with the exploitation of domain knowledge, in the form of Carson's equations, through nonlinear mathematical optimization. The proposed approach derives impedance matrices for up-to-four-wire systems, using measurement data like those obtained from smart meters. Despite the lack of phasor measurements, the low signal-to-noise ratio of smart meter measurements, and the inherent existence of multiple equivalent solutions, our method produces good quality impedance models that are fit for power system calculations, significantly improving on our previous work both in terms of accuracy and computational time.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Open Source Validation System for Continuous Arterial Blood Pressure Measuring Sensors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07973v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Measuring the blood pressure waveform is becoming a more frequently studied area. The development of sensor technologies opens many new ways to be able to measure high-quality signals. The development of such an aim-specific sensor can be time-consuming, expensive, and difficult to test or validate with known and consistent waveforms. In this paper, we present an open source blood pressure waveform simulator with an open source Python validation package to reduce development costs for early-stage sensor development and research. The simulator mainly consists of 3D printed parts which technology has become a widely available and cheap solution. The core part of the simulator is a 3D printed cam that can be generated based on real blood pressure waveforms. The validation framework can create a detailed comparison between the signal waveform used to design the cam and the measured time series from the sensor being validated. The presented simulator proved to be robust and accurate in short- and long-term use, as it produced the signal waveform consistently and accurately. To validate this solution, a 3D force sensor was used, which was proven earlier to be able to measure high-quality blood pressure waveforms on the radial artery at the wrist. The results showed high similarity between the measured and the nominal waveforms, meaning that comparing the normalized signals, the RMSE value ranged from $0.0276 \pm 0.0047$ to $0.0212 \pm 0.0023$, and the Pearson correlation ranged from $0.9933 \pm 0.0027$ to $0.9978 \pm 0.0005$. Our validation framework is available at https://github.com/repat8/cam-bpw-sim. Our hardware framework, which allows reproduction of the presented solution, is available at https://github.com/repat8/cam-bpw-sim-hardware.

| **[TSFM-Bench: A Comprehensive and Unified Benchmarking of Foundation Models for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11802v5)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Forecasting (TSF) is key functionality in numerous fields, such as financial investment, weather services, and energy management. Although increasingly capable TSF methods occur, many of them require domain-specific data collection and model training and do not generalize well when applied in other domains. Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) that are pre-trained on massive heterogeneous time series data aim to overcome these limitations. The prospects for generalizability have spurred the development of a new generation of TSFMs. This study proposes a benchmark, TSFM-Bench, to facilitate comprehensive and unified evaluation of TSFMs. TSFM-Bench covers a wide range of TSFMs, including those based on large language models and those pre-trained on time series data. TSFM-Bench supports multiple forecasting scenarios, including zero-shot, few-shot, and full-shot, enabling assessment across the full range of adaptation strategies. TSFM-Bench also provides a standardized experimental protocols for critical evaluation processes such as dataset splitting, loading, normalization, and few-shot sampling, facilitating consistency and fairness. We report on an extensive evaluation of TSFMs across a diverse range of datasets spanning multiple domains and exhibiting varied statistical characteristics. Specifically, we identify pros and cons and inherent limitations of existing TSFMs, and we propose potential directions for new model designs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distributed lag non-linear models with Laplacian-P-splines for analysis of spatially structured time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04814v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed lag non-linear models (DLNM) have gained popularity for modeling nonlinear lagged relationships between exposures and outcomes. When applied to spatially referenced data, these models must account for spatial dependence, a challenge that has yet to be thoroughly explored within the penalized DLNM framework. This gap is mainly due to the complex model structure and high computational demands, particularly when dealing with large spatio-temporal datasets. To address this, we propose a novel Bayesian DLNM-Laplacian-P-splines (DLNM-LPS) approach that incorporates spatial dependence using conditional autoregressive (CAR) priors, a method commonly applied in disease mapping. Our approach offers a flexible framework for capturing nonlinear associations while accounting for spatial dependence. It uses the Laplace approximation to approximate the conditional posterior distribution of the regression parameters, eliminating the need for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, often used in Bayesian inference, thus improving computational efficiency. The methodology is evaluated through simulation studies and applied to analyze the relationship between temperature and mortality in London.</p></details> |  |
| **[Augmented Invertible Koopman Autoencoder for long-term time series forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12930v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Following the introduction of Dynamic Mode Decomposition and its numerous extensions, many neural autoencoder-based implementations of the Koopman operator have recently been proposed. This class of methods appears to be of interest for modeling dynamical systems, either through direct long-term prediction of the evolution of the state or as a powerful embedding for downstream methods. In particular, a recent line of work has developed invertible Koopman autoencoders (IKAEs), which provide an exact reconstruction of the input state thanks to their analytically invertible encoder, based on coupling layer normalizing flow models. We identify that the conservation of the dimension imposed by the normalizing flows is a limitation for the IKAE models, and thus we propose to augment the latent state with a second, non-invertible encoder network. This results in our new model: the Augmented Invertible Koopman AutoEncoder (AIKAE). We demonstrate the relevance of the AIKAE through a series of long-term time series forecasting experiments, on satellite image time series as well as on a benchmark involving predictions based on a large lookback window of observations.</p></details> |  |

To asses it, we evaluated ten base models and eight ensemble configurations across two large-scale retail datasets (M5 and VN1), considering both point and probabilistic accuracy under varying retraining frequencies. We showed that ensembles consistently improve forecasting performance, particularly in probabilistic settings. However, these gains come at a substantial computational cost, especially for larger, accuracy-driven ensembles. We found that reducing retraining frequency significantly lowers costs, with minimal impact on accuracy, particularly for point forecasts. Moreover, efficiency-driven ensembles offer a strong balance, achieving competitive accuracy with considerably lower costs compared to accuracy-optimized combinations. Most importantly, small ensembles of two or three models are often sufficient to achieve near-optimal results. These findings provide practical guidelines for deploying scalable and cost-efficient forecasting systems, supporting the broader goals of sustainable AI in forecasting. Overall, this work shows that careful ensemble design and retraining strategy selection can yield accurate, robust, and cost-effective forecasts suitable for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Proactive Model Adaptation Against Concept Drift for Online Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08435v4)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting always faces the challenge of concept drift, where data distributions evolve over time, leading to a decline in forecast model performance. Existing solutions are based on online learning, which continually organize recent time series observations as new training samples and update model parameters according to the forecasting feedback on recent data. However, they overlook a critical issue: obtaining ground-truth future values of each sample should be delayed until after the forecast horizon. This delay creates a temporal gap between the training samples and the test sample. Our empirical analysis reveals that the gap can introduce concept drift, causing forecast models to adapt to outdated concepts. In this paper, we present Proceed, a novel proactive model adaptation framework for online time series forecasting. Proceed first estimates the concept drift between the recently used training samples and the current test sample. It then employs an adaptation generator to efficiently translate the estimated drift into parameter adjustments, proactively adapting the model to the test sample. To enhance the generalization capability of the framework, Proceed is trained on synthetic diverse concept drifts. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets across various forecast models demonstrate that Proceed brings more performance improvements than the state-of-the-art online learning methods, significantly facilitating forecast models' resilience against concept drifts.

| **[Foundation Models Knowledge Distillation For Battery Capacity Degradation Forecast](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08151v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate estimation of lithium-ion battery capacity degradation is critical for enhancing the reliability and safety of battery operations. Traditional expert models, tailored to specific scenarios, provide isolated estimations. With the rapid advancement of data-driven techniques, a series of general-purpose time-series foundation models have been developed. However, foundation models specifically designed for battery capacity degradation remain largely unexplored. To enable zero-shot generalization in battery degradation prediction using large model technology, this study proposes a degradation-aware fine-tuning strategy for time-series foundation models. We apply this strategy to fine-tune the Timer model on approximately 10 GB of open-source battery charge discharge data. Validation on our released CycleLife-SJTUIE dataset demonstrates that the fine-tuned Battery-Timer possesses strong zero-shot generalization capability in capacity degradation forecasting. To address the computational challenges of deploying large models, we further propose a knowledge distillation framework that transfers the knowledge of pre-trained foundation models into compact expert models. Distillation results across several state-of-the-art time-series expert models confirm that foundation model knowledge significantly improves the multi-condition generalization of expert models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural MJD: Neural Non-Stationary Merton Jump Diffusion for Time Series Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04542v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While deep learning methods have achieved strong performance in time series prediction, their black-box nature and inability to explicitly model underlying stochastic processes often limit their generalization to non-stationary data, especially in the presence of abrupt changes. In this work, we introduce Neural MJD, a neural network based non-stationary Merton jump diffusion (MJD) model. Our model explicitly formulates forecasting as a stochastic differential equation (SDE) simulation problem, combining a time-inhomogeneous It\^o diffusion to capture non-stationary stochastic dynamics with a time-inhomogeneous compound Poisson process to model abrupt jumps. To enable tractable learning, we introduce a likelihood truncation mechanism that caps the number of jumps within small time intervals and provide a theoretical error bound for this approximation. Additionally, we propose an Euler-Maruyama with restart solver, which achieves a provably lower error bound in estimating expected states and reduced variance compared to the standard solver. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Neural MJD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and statistical learning methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing parameter identifiability of a hemodynamics PDE model using spectral surrogates and dimension reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04538v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational inverse problems for biomedical simulators suffer from limited data and relatively high parameter dimensionality. This often requires sensitivity analysis, where parameters of the model are ranked based on their influence on the specific quantities of interest. This is especially important for simulators used to build medical digital twins, as the amount of data is typically limited. For expensive models, such as blood flow models, emulation is employed to expedite the simulation time. Parameter ranking and fixing using sensitivity analysis are often heuristic, though, and vary with the specific application or simulator used. The present study provides an innovative solution to this problem by leveraging polynomial chaos expansions (PCEs) for both multioutput global sensitivity analysis and formal parameter identifiability. For the former, we use dimension reduction to efficiently quantify time-series sensitivity of a one-dimensional pulmonary hemodynamics model. We consider both Windkessel and structured tree boundary conditions. We then use PCEs to construct profile-likelihood confidence intervals to formally assess parameter identifiability, and show how changes in experimental design improve identifiability. Our work presents a novel approach to determining parameter identifiability and leverages a common emulation strategy for enabling profile-likelihood analysis in problems governed by partial differential equations.</p></details> | 30 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Smoothing Variances Across Time: Adaptive Stochastic Volatility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11315v4)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel Bayesian framework for estimating time-varying volatility by extending the Random Walk Stochastic Volatility (RWSV) model with Dynamic Shrinkage Processes (DSP) in log-variances. Unlike the classical Stochastic Volatility (SV) or GARCH-type models with restrictive parametric stationarity assumptions, our proposed Adaptive Stochastic Volatility (ASV) model provides smooth yet dynamically adaptive estimates of evolving volatility and its uncertainty. We further enhance the model by incorporating a nugget effect, allowing it to flexibly capture small-scale variability while preserving smoothness elsewhere. We derive the theoretical properties of the global-local shrinkage prior DSP. Through simulation studies, we show that ASV exhibits remarkable misspecification resilience and low prediction error across various data-generating processes. Furthermore, ASV's capacity to yield locally smooth and interpretable estimates facilitates a clearer understanding of the underlying patterns and trends in volatility. As an extension, we develop the Bayesian Trend Filter with ASV (BTF-ASV) which allows joint modeling of the mean and volatility with abrupt changes. Finally, our proposed models are applied to time series data from finance, econometrics, and environmental science, highlighting their flexibility and broad applicability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mechanistic models for panel data: Analysis of ecological experiments with four interacting species](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04508v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In an ecological context, panel data arise when time series measurements are made on a collection of ecological processes. Each process may correspond to a spatial location for field data, or to an experimental ecosystem in a designed experiment. Statistical models for ecological panel data should capture the high levels of nonlinearity, stochasticity, and measurement uncertainty inherent in ecological systems. Furthermore, the system dynamics may depend on unobservable variables. This study applies iterated particle filtering techniques to explore new possibilities for likelihood-based statistical analysis of these complex systems. We analyze data from a mesocosm experiment in which two species of the freshwater planktonic crustacean genus, {\it Daphnia}, coexist with an alga and a fungal parasite. Time series data were collected on replicated mesocosms under six treatment conditions. Iterated filtering enables maximization of the likelihood for scientifically motivated nonlinear partially observed Markov process models, providing access to standard likelihood-based methods for parameter estimation, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, model selection and diagnostics. This toolbox allows scientists to propose and evaluate scientifically motivated stochastic dynamic models for panel data, constrained only by the requirement to write code to simulate from the model and to specify a measurement distribution describing how the system state is observed.</p></details> | 35 pages, 4 figures |

The goal is to introduce a method that avoids premature or delayed detection, which can lead to inaccurate or inefficient performance analysis. The proposed approach adapts techniques from the chemical reactors domain, detecting steady states online through the combination of kernel-based step detection and statistical methods. By using a window-based approach, it provides detailed information and improves the accuracy of identifying phase transitions, even in noisy or irregular time series. Results show that the new approach reduces total error by 14.5% compared to the state-of-the-art method. It offers more reliable detection of the steady-state onset, delivering greater precision for benchmarking tasks. For users, the new approach enhances the accuracy and stability of performance benchmarking, efficiently handling diverse time series data. Its robustness and adaptability make it a valuable tool for real-world performance evaluation, ensuring consistent and reproducible results.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is under review by Future Generation Computer Systems</p></details> |

CatNet employs the derivative of SHAP values to quantify the feature importance, and constructs a vector-formed mirror statistic for FDR control with the Gaussian Mirror algorithm. To avoid instability due to nonlinear or temporal correlations among features, we also propose a new kernel-based independence measure. CatNet performs robustly on different model settings with both simulated and real-world data, which reduces overfitting and improves interpretability of the model. Our framework that introduces SHAP for feature importance in FDR control algorithms and improves Gaussian Mirror can be naturally extended to other time-series or sequential deep learning models.</p></details> |  |

These inputs are useful for diverse remote sensing tasks, such as crop mapping and flood detection. However, learning shared representations of remote sensing data is challenging, given the diversity of relevant data modalities, and because objects of interest vary massively in scale, from small boats (1-2 pixels and fast) to glaciers (thousands of pixels and slow). We present a novel self-supervised learning algorithm that extracts multi-scale features across a flexible set of input modalities through masked modeling. Our dual global and local contrastive losses differ in their targets (deep representations vs. shallow input projections) and masking strategies (structured vs. not). Our Galileo is a single generalist model that outperforms SoTA specialist models for satellite images and pixel time series across eleven benchmarks and multiple tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causality-Aware Contrastive Learning for Robust Multivariate Time-Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03964v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Utilizing the complex inter-variable causal relationships within multivariate time-series provides a promising avenue toward more robust and reliable multivariate time-series anomaly detection (MTSAD) but remains an underexplored area of research. This paper proposes Causality-Aware contrastive learning for RObust multivariate Time-Series (CAROTS), a novel MTSAD pipeline that incorporates the notion of causality into contrastive learning. CAROTS employs two data augmentors to obtain causality-preserving and -disturbing samples that serve as a wide range of normal variations and synthetic anomalies, respectively. With causality-preserving and -disturbing samples as positives and negatives, CAROTS performs contrastive learning to train an encoder whose latent space separates normal and abnormal samples based on causality. Moreover, CAROTS introduces a similarity-filtered one-class contrastive loss that encourages the contrastive learning process to gradually incorporate more semantically diverse samples with common causal relationships. Extensive experiments on five real-world and two synthetic datasets validate that the integration of causal relationships endows CAROTS with improved MTSAD capabilities.

| **[Semi-Supervised Model-Free Bayesian State Estimation from Compressed Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07368v6)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider data-driven Bayesian state estimation from compressed measurements (BSCM) of a model-free process. The dimension of the temporal measurement vector is lower than that of the temporal state vector to be estimated, leading to an under-determined inverse problem. The underlying dynamical model of the state's evolution is unknown for a 'model-free process.' Hence, it is difficult to use traditional model-driven methods, for example, Kalman and particle filters. Instead, we consider data-driven methods. We experimentally show that two existing unsupervised learning-based data-driven methods fail to address the BSCM problem in a model-free process. The methods are -- data-driven nonlinear state estimation (DANSE) and deep Markov model (DMM). While DANSE provides good predictive/forecasting performance to model the temporal measurement data as a time series, its unsupervised learning lacks suitable regularization for tackling the BSCM task. We then propose a semi-supervised learning approach and develop a semi-supervised learning-based DANSE method, referred to as SemiDANSE. In SemiDANSE, we use a large amount of unlabelled data along with a limited amount of labelled data, i.e., pairwise measurement-and-state data, which provides the desired regularization. Using three benchmark dynamical systems, we empirically show that the data-driven SemiDANSE provides competitive state estimation performance for BSCM using a handful of different measurement systems, against a hybrid method called KalmanNet and two model-driven methods (extended Kalman filter and unscented Kalman filter) that know the dynamical models exactly.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 12 figures, under review in IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing</p></details> |

Unfortunately they work for small data only. In turn they are not attractive to offer reasons for events, e.g., tracking causal changes over multiple time steps, or a behavioral component that involves feedback loops through actions of an agent. To this end, we generalize SCEs to a (recursive) formulation of explanation trees to capture the temporal interactions between reasons. We show the benefits of this more general SCE algorithm on synthetic time-series data and a 2D grid game, and further compare it to the base SCE and other existing methods for causal explanations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main paper: 9 pages, References: 2 pages, Supplementary: 9 pages.

| **[Signals as a First-Class Citizen When Querying Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03826v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) tightly integrate computation with physical entities, often generating vast amounts of time series data from thousands of sensors. Although knowledge graphs offer a powerful means to contextualize these data, existing approaches to integrating knowledge graphs with time series data lack a concept to model the continuous temporal values inherent in CPSs. This gap can make expressing computations on the sensor data cumbersome. In this work, we propose the integration of knowledge graphs and signals, a proven concept for modeling temporal values. By treating signals as first-class citizens in query languages, we can enable seamless querying over knowledge graphs and signals. While the knowledge graph captures information on the CPS, signals represent its run-time data from sensors. We discuss the implications of such an approach and propose SigSPARQL, an extension to the SPARQL query language, to demonstrate these concepts. Furthermore, we evaluate the feasibility of implementing SigSPARQL with a prototype and demonstrate the applicability of the query language for a monitoring use case within a CPS.</p></details> |  |

While the standard self attention only makes use of the inner product of queries and keys, it is demonstrated that the keys, queries and softmax are not necessary for obtaining the attention score required to capture long-term dependencies in temporal sequences. Through the singular-value decomposition (SVD) on the softmax attention score, we further observe that self attention compresses the contributions from both queries and keys in the space spanned by the attention score. Therefore, our proposed easy-attention method directly treats the attention scores as learnable parameters. This approach produces excellent results when reconstructing and predicting the temporal dynamics of chaotic systems exhibiting more robustness and less complexity than self attention or the widely-used long short-term memory (LSTM) network. We show the improved performance of the easy-attention method in the Lorenz system, a turbulence shear flow and a model of a nuclear reactor.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages and 6 figures</p></details> |

Hence, spatial-aware pretext tasks have been actively explored in self-supervised learning. Existing works commonly start from a grid structure, where the goal of the pretext task involves predicting the absolute position index of patches within a fixed grid. However, grid-based approaches fall short of capturing the fluid and continuous nature of real-world object compositions. We introduce PART, a self-supervised learning approach that leverages continuous relative transformations between off-grid patches to overcome these limitations. By modeling how parts relate to each other in a continuous space, PART learns the relative composition of images-an off-grid structural relative positioning process that generalizes beyond occlusions and deformations. In tasks requiring precise spatial understanding such as object detection and time series prediction, PART outperforms strong grid-based methods like MAE and DropPos, while also maintaining competitive performance on global classification tasks with minimal hyperparameter tuning. By breaking free from grid constraints, PART opens up an exciting new trajectory for universal self-supervised pretraining across diverse datatypes-from natural images to EEG signals-with promising potential in video, medical imaging, and audio.</p></details> |  |
| **[SF$^2$Bench: Evaluating Data-Driven Models for Compound Flood Forecasting in South Florida](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04281v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting compound floods presents a significant challenge due to the intricate interplay of meteorological, hydrological, and oceanographic factors. Analyzing compound floods has become more critical as the global climate increases flood risks. Traditional physics-based methods, such as the Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System, are often time-inefficient. Machine learning has recently demonstrated promise in both modeling accuracy and computational efficiency. However, the scarcity of comprehensive datasets currently hinders systematic analysis. Existing water-related datasets are often limited by a sparse network of monitoring stations and incomplete coverage of relevant factors. To address this challenge, we introduce SF2Bench, a comprehensive time series collection on compound floods in South Florida, which integrates four key factors: tide, rainfall, groundwater, and human management activities (gate and pump controlling). This integration allows for a more detailed analysis of the individual contributions of these drivers to compound flooding and informs the development of improved flood forecasting approaches. To comprehensively evaluate the potential of various modeling paradigms, we assess the performance of six categories of methods, encompassing Multilayer Perceptrons, Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, Graph Neural Networks, Transformers, and Large Language Models. We verified the impact of different key features on flood forecasting through experiments. Our analysis examines temporal and spatial aspects, providing insights into the influence of historical data and spatial dependencies. The varying performance across these approaches underscores the diverse capabilities of each in capturing complex temporal and spatial dependencies inherent in compound floods.</p></details> | 60 Pages |

Recently, there has been initial exploration of applying diffusion models to time series tasks. However, existing studies still face challenges in multi-scale feature alignment and generative capabilities across different entities and long-time scales. In this paper, we propose CHIME, a conditional hallucination and integrated multi-scale enhancement framework for time series diffusion models. By employing multi-scale decomposition and adaptive integration, CHIME captures the decomposed features of time series, achieving in-domain distribution alignment between generated and original samples. In addition, we introduce a feature hallucination module in the conditional denoising process, enabling the transfer of temporal features through the training of category-independent transformation layers. Experimental results on publicly available real-world datasets demonstrate that CHIME achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits excellent generative generalization capabilities in few-shot scenarios.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce VISTA (Vision-Language Inference for Stock Time-series Analysis), a novel, training-free framework that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for multi-modal stock forecasting. VISTA prompts a VLM with both textual representations of historical stock prices and their corresponding line charts to predict future price values. By combining numerical and visual modalities in a zero-shot setting and using carefully designed chain-of-thought prompts, VISTA captures complementary patterns that unimodal approaches often miss. We benchmark VISTA against standard baselines, including ARIMA and text-only LLM-based prompting methods. Experimental results show that VISTA outperforms these baselines by up to 89.83%, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-modal inference for stock time-series analysis and highlighting the potential of VLMs in financial forecasting tasks without requiring task-specific training.</p></details> |  |

However, their internal representations and learned concepts are still not well understood. In this study, we investigate the structure and redundancy of representations across various TSFMs, examining the self-similarity of model layers within and across different model sizes. This analysis reveals block-like redundancy in the representations, which can be utilized for informed pruning to improve inference speed and efficiency. Additionally, we explore the concepts learned by these models - such as periodicity and trends - and how these can be manipulated through latent space steering to influence model behavior. Our experiments show that steering interventions can introduce new features, e.g., adding periodicity or trends to signals that initially lacked them. These findings underscore the value of representational analysis for optimizing models and demonstrate how conceptual steering offers new possibilities for more controlled and efficient time series analysis with TSFMs.</p></details> | Accepted at ICML'25 |

Traditional approaches using NDRE often detect stress only after visible symptoms appear or require labeled datasets, limiting scalability. This study introduces EigenCL, a novel unsupervised contrastive learning framework guided by temporal NDRE dynamics and biologically grounded eigen decomposition. Using over 10,000 Sentinel-2 NDRE image patches from drought-affected Iowa cornfields, we constructed five-point NDRE time series per patch and derived an RBF similarity matrix. The principal eigenvector explaining 76% of the variance and strongly correlated (r = 0.95) with raw NDRE values was used to define stress-aware similarity for contrastive embedding learning. Unlike existing methods that rely on visual augmentations, EigenCL pulls embeddings together based on biologically similar stress trajectories and pushes apart divergent ones. The learned embeddings formed physiologically meaningful clusters, achieving superior clustering metrics (Silhouette: 0.748, DBI: 0.35) and enabling 76% early stress detection up to 12 days before conventional NDRE thresholds. Downstream classification yielded 95% k-NN and 91% logistic regression accuracy. Validation on an independent 2023 Nebraska dataset confirmed generalizability without retraining. EigenCL offers a label-free, scalable approach for early stress detection that aligns with underlying plant physiology and is suitable for real-world deployment in data-scarce agricultural environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Necessity of Multi-Domain Explanation: An Uncertainty Principle Approach for Deep Time Series Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03267v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A prevailing approach to explain time series models is to generate attribution in time domain. A recent development in time series XAI is the concept of explanation spaces, where any model trained in the time domain can be interpreted with any existing XAI method in alternative domains, such as frequency. The prevailing approach is to present XAI attributions either in the time domain or in the domain where the attribution is most sparse. In this paper, we demonstrate that in certain cases, XAI methods can generate attributions that highlight fundamentally different features in the time and frequency domains that are not direct counterparts of one another. This suggests that both domains' attributions should be presented to achieve a more comprehensive interpretation. Thus it shows the necessity of multi-domain explanation. To quantify when such cases arise, we introduce the uncertainty principle (UP), originally developed in quantum mechanics and later studied in harmonic analysis and signal processing, to the XAI literature. This principle establishes a lower bound on how much a signal can be simultaneously localized in both the time and frequency domains. By leveraging this concept, we assess whether attributions in the time and frequency domains violate this bound, indicating that they emphasize distinct features. In other words, UP provides a sufficient condition that the time and frequency domain explanations do not match and, hence, should be both presented to the end user. We validate the effectiveness of this approach across various deep learning models, XAI methods, and a wide range of classification and forecasting datasets. The frequent occurrence of UP violations across various datasets and XAI methods highlights the limitations of existing approaches that focus solely on time-domain explanations. This underscores the need for multi-domain explanations as a new paradigm.</p></details> |  |

To address the challenge of data scarcity, we propose Informative Covariate Augmentation, which enables the training of COSMIC without requiring any datasets that include covariates. COSMIC achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot forecasting, both with and without covariates. Our quantitative and qualitative analysis demonstrates that COSMIC effectively leverages covariates in zero-shot forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper was written at the end of 2024</p></details> |

However, the plethora of model formulations, the inconsistent use of terminology, and the various inferential approaches and software packages can be overwhelming to practitioners, especially when they are new to this area. With this review-like paper, we thus aim to provide guidance for both statisticians and practitioners working with latent Markov models by offering a unifying view on what otherwise are often considered separate model classes, from hidden Markov models over state-space models to Markov-modulated Poisson processes. In particular, we provide a roadmap for identifying a suitable latent Markov model formulation given the data to be analysed. Furthermore, we emphasise that it is key to applied work with any of these model classes to understand how recursive techniques exploiting the models' dependence structure can be used for inference. The R package LaMa adapts this unified view and provides an easy-to-use framework for very fast (C++ based) numerical maximum likelihood estimation of any of the models discussed in this paper, allowing users to tailor a latent Markov model to their data using a Lego-type approach.</p></details> | 52 pages, 7 figures |

Firstly, the basic information and transaction data of popular NFTs on the Solana chain are collected using the Selenium tool. Secondly, the transaction records of the Magic Eden trading market are thoroughly analyzed by combining them with the Scrapy framework to examine the price fluctuations and market trends of NFTs. In terms of data analysis, this paper employs time series analysis to examine the dynamics of the NFT market and seeks to identify potential price patterns. In addition, the risk and return of different NFTs are evaluated using the mean-variance optimization model, taking into account their characteristics, such as illiquidity and market volatility, to provide investors with data-driven portfolio recommendations. The experimental results show that the combination of crawler technology and financial analytics can effectively analyze NFT data on the Solana blockchain and provide timely market insights and investment strategies.

| **[Binary Cumulative Encoding meets Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24595v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies in time series forecasting have explored formulating regression via classification task. By discretizing the continuous target space into bins and predicting over a fixed set of classes, these approaches benefit from stable training, robust uncertainty modeling, and compatibility with modern deep learning architectures. However, most existing methods rely on one-hot encoding that ignores the inherent ordinal structure of the underlying values. As a result, they fail to provide information about the relative distance between predicted and true values during training. In this paper, we propose to address this limitation by introducing binary cumulative encoding (BCE), that represents scalar targets into monotonic binary vectors. This encoding implicitly preserves order and magnitude information, allowing the model to learn distance-aware representations while still operating within a classification framework. We propose a convolutional neural network architecture specifically designed for BCE, incorporating residual and dilated convolutions to enable fast and expressive temporal modeling. Through extensive experiments on benchmark forecasting datasets, we show that our approach outperforms widely used methods in both point and probabilistic forecasting, while requiring fewer parameters and enabling faster training.</p></details> |  |

Due to the time-intensive nature of shapelet discovery, existing shapelet-based methods mainly focus on selecting discriminative shapes while discarding others to achieve candidate subsequence sparsification. However, this approach may exclude beneficial shapes and overlook the varying contributions of shapelets to classification performance. To this end, we propose a Soft sparse Shapes (SoftShape) model for efficient time series classification. Our approach mainly introduces soft shape sparsification and soft shape learning blocks. The former transforms shapes into soft representations based on classification contribution scores, merging lower-scored ones into a single shape to retain and differentiate all subsequence information. The latter facilitates intra- and inter-shape temporal pattern learning, improving model efficiency by using sparsified soft shapes as inputs. Specifically, we employ a learnable router to activate a subset of class-specific expert networks for intra-shape pattern learning. Meanwhile, a shared expert network learns inter-shape patterns by converting sparsified shapes into sequences. Extensive experiments show that SoftShape outperforms state-of-the-art methods and produces interpretable results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICML 2025</p></details> |

These models leverage the self-attention mechanism to capture long-term temporal or variate dependencies in sequences. Existing methods can be divided into two approaches: (1) reducing computational cost of attention by making the calculations sparse, and (2) reshaping the input data to aggregate temporal features. However, existing attention mechanisms may not adequately capture inherent nonlinear dependencies present in time series data, leaving room for improvement. In this study, we propose a novel attention mechanism based on Chatterjee's rank correlation coefficient, which measures nonlinear dependencies between variables. Specifically, we replace the matrix multiplication in standard attention mechanisms with this rank coefficient to measure the query-key relationship. Since computing Chatterjee's correlation coefficient involves sorting and ranking operations, we introduce a differentiable approximation employing SoftSort and SoftRank. Our proposed mechanism, ``XicorAttention,'' integrates it into several state-of-the-art Transformer models. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that incorporating nonlinear correlation into the attention improves forecasting accuracy by up to approximately 9.1\% compared to existing models.</p></details> |  |

| **[SDE: A Simplified and Disentangled Dependency Encoding Framework for State Space Models in Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12068v3)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, advancements in deep learning have spurred the development of numerous models for Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF). However, most existing approaches struggle to fully capture the complex and structured dependencies inherent in time series data. In this work, we identify and formally define three critical dependencies that are fundamental to forecasting accuracy: order dependency and semantic dependency along the temporal dimension, as well as cross-variate dependency across the feature dimension. These dependencies are often treated in isolation, and improper handling can introduce noise and degrade forecasting performance. To bridge this gap, we investigate the potential of State Space Models (SSMs) for LTSF and emphasize their inherent advantages in capturing these essential dependencies. Additionally, we empirically observe that excessive nonlinearity in conventional SSMs introduce redundancy when applied to semantically sparse time series data. Motivated by this insight, we propose SDE (Simplified and Disentangled Dependency Encoding), a novel framework designed to enhance the capability of SSMs for LTSF. Specifically, we first eliminate unnecessary nonlinearities in vanilla SSMs, thereby improving the suitability for time series forecasting. Building on this foundation, we introduce a disentangled encoding strategy, which empowers SSMs to efficiently model cross-variate dependencies while mitigating interference between the temporal and feature dimensions. Furthermore, we provide rigorous theoretical justifications to substantiate our design choices. Extensive experiments on nine real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that SDE-enhanced SSMs consistently outperform state-of-the-art time series forecasting models.Our code is available at https://github.com/YukinoAsuna/SAMBA.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2025 |

To this end, we try to bridge this gap and thoroughly evaluate the theoretical properties and practical performance of 24 deterministic and probabilistic company fundamentals forecasting models on real company data. We observe that deep learning models provide superior forecasting performance to classical models, in particular when considering uncertainty estimation. To validate the findings, we compare them to human analyst expectations and find that their accuracy is comparable to the automatic forecasts. We further show how these high-quality forecasts can benefit automated stock allocation. We close by presenting possible ways of integrating domain experts to further improve performance and increase reliability.</p></details> | <details><summary>See h...</summary><p>See https://openreview.net/forum?id=haf78jerSt</p></details> |
| **[Dynamical Label Augmentation and Calibration for Noisy Electronic Health Records](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07320v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical research, particularly in predicting patient outcomes, heavily relies on medical time series data extracted from Electronic Health Records (EHR), which provide extensive information on patient histories. Despite rigorous examination, labeling errors are inevitable and can significantly impede accurate predictions of patient outcome. To address this challenge, we propose an \textbf{A}ttention-based Learning Framework with Dynamic \textbf{C}alibration and Augmentation for \textbf{T}ime series Noisy \textbf{L}abel \textbf{L}earning (ACTLL). This framework leverages a two-component Beta mixture model to identify the certain and uncertain sets of instances based on the fitness distribution of each class, and it captures global temporal dynamics while dynamically calibrating labels from the uncertain set or augmenting confident instances from the certain set. Experimental results on large-scale EHR datasets eICU and MIMIC-IV-ED, and several benchmark datasets from the UCR and UEA repositories, demonstrate that our model ACTLL has achieved state-of-the-art performance, especially under high noise levels.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discovering Latent Causal Graphs from Spatio-Temporal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05331v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many important phenomena in scientific fields like climate, neuroscience, and epidemiology are naturally represented as spatiotemporal gridded data with complex interactions. Inferring causal relationships from these data is a challenging problem compounded by the high dimensionality of such data and the correlations between spatially proximate points. We present SPACY (SPAtiotemporal Causal discoverY), a novel framework based on variational inference, designed to model latent time series and their causal relationships from spatiotemporal data. SPACY alleviates the high-dimensional challenge by discovering causal structures in the latent space. To aggregate spatially proximate, correlated grid points, we use \change{spatial factors, parametrized by spatial kernel functions}, to map observational time series to latent representations. \change{Theoretically, we generalize the problem to a continuous spatial domain and establish identifiability when the observations arise from a nonlinear, invertible function of the product of latent series and spatial factors. Using this approach, we avoid assumptions that are often unverifiable, including those about instantaneous effects or sufficient variability.} Empirically, SPACY outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on synthetic data, even in challenging settings where existing methods struggle, while remaining scalable for large grids. SPACY also identifies key known phenomena from real-world climate data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Forecasting of Sparse Intraoperative Hypotension Events Powered by Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22116v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) frequently occurs under general anesthesia and is strongly linked to adverse outcomes such as myocardial injury and increased mortality. Despite its significance, IOH prediction is hindered by event sparsity and the challenge of integrating static and dynamic data across diverse patients. In this paper, we propose \textbf{IOHFuseLM}, a multimodal language model framework. To accurately identify and differentiate sparse hypotensive events, we leverage a two-stage training strategy. The first stage involves domain adaptive pretraining on IOH physiological time series augmented through diffusion methods, thereby enhancing the model sensitivity to patterns associated with hypotension. Subsequently, task fine-tuning is performed on the original clinical dataset to further enhance the ability to distinguish normotensive from hypotensive states. To enable multimodal fusion for each patient, we align structured clinical descriptions with the corresponding physiological time series at the token level. Such alignment enables the model to capture individualized temporal patterns alongside their corresponding clinical semantics. In addition, we convert static patient attributes into structured text to enrich personalized information. Experimental evaluations on two intraoperative datasets demonstrate that IOHFuseLM outperforms established baselines in accurately identifying IOH events, highlighting its applicability in clinical decision support scenarios. Our code is publicly available to promote reproducibility at https://github.com/zjt-gpu/IOHFuseLM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Univariate to Multivariate: LLMs as Zero-Shot Predictors for Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02389v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series prediction or forecasting is critical across many real-world dynamic systems, and recent studies have proposed using Large Language Models (LLMs) for this task due to their strong generalization capabilities and ability to perform well without extensive pre-training. However, their effectiveness in handling complex, noisy, and multivariate time-series data remains underexplored. To address this, we propose LLMPred which enhances LLM-based time-series prediction by converting time-series sequences into text and feeding them to LLMs for zero shot prediction along with two main data pre-processing techniques. First, we apply time-series sequence decomposition to facilitate accurate prediction on complex and noisy univariate sequences. Second, we extend this univariate prediction capability to multivariate data using a lightweight prompt-processing strategy. Extensive experiments with smaller LLMs such as Llama 2 7B, Llama 3.2 3B, GPT-4o-mini, and DeepSeek 7B demonstrate that LLMPred achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Additionally, a thorough ablation study highlights the importance of the key components proposed in LLMPred.</p></details> |  |

Paris, France during late the spring and summer months is the major focus. Predictors and responses are drawn from the Paris-Montsouris weather station for the years 2018 through 2024. Q(.95) values are used because of interest in summer heat that is statistically rare and extreme. The data are curated as a multiple time series for each year. Predictors include seven routinely collected indicators of weather conditions. They each are lagged by 14 days such that temperature and heat index forecasts are provided two weeks in advance. Forecasting uncertainty is addressed with conformal prediction regions. Forecasting accuracy is promising. Cairo, Egypt is a second location using data from the weather station at the Cairo Internal Airport over the same years and months. Cairo is a more challenging setting for temperature forecasting because its desert climate can create abrupt and erratic temperature changes. Yet, there is some progress forecasting record-setting hot days.</p></details> | 10 figures |
| **[De-Biasing Structure Function Estimates From Sparse Time Series of the Solar Wind: A Data-Driven Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10053v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Structure functions, which represent the moments of the increments of a stochastic process, are essential complementary statistics to power spectra for analysing the self-similar behaviour of a time series. However, many real-world environmental datasets, such as those collected by spacecraft monitoring the solar wind, contain gaps, which inevitably corrupt the statistics. The nature of this corruption for structure functions remains poorly understood - indeed, often overlooked. Here we simulate gaps in a large set of magnetic field intervals from Parker Solar Probe in order to characterize the behaviour of the structure function of a sparse time series of solar wind turbulence. We quantify the resultant error with regards to the overall shape of the structure function, and its slope in the inertial range. Noting the consistent underestimation of the true curve when using linear interpolation, we demonstrate the ability of an empirical correction factor to de-bias these estimates. This correction, "learnt" from the data from a single spacecraft, is shown to generalize well to data from a solar wind regime elsewhere in the heliosphere, producing smaller errors, on average, for missing fractions >25%. Given this success, we apply the correction to gap-affected Voyager intervals from the inner heliosheath and local interstellar medium, obtaining spectral indices similar to those from previous studies. This work provides a tool for future studies of fragmented solar wind time series, such as those from Voyager, MAVEN, and OMNI, as well as sparsely-sampled astrophysical and geophysical processes more generally.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Performative Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06077v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series forecasting is a critical challenge in various domains and has witnessed substantial progress in recent years. Many real-life scenarios, such as public health, economics, and social applications, involve feedback loops where predictions can influence the predicted outcome, subsequently altering the target variable's distribution. This phenomenon, known as performativity, introduces the potential for 'self-negating' or 'self-fulfilling' predictions. Despite extensive studies in classification problems across domains, performativity remains largely unexplored in the context of time-series forecasting from a machine-learning perspective. In this paper, we formalize performative time-series forecasting (PeTS), addressing the challenge of accurate predictions when performativity-induced distribution shifts are possible. We propose a novel approach, Feature Performative-Shifting (FPS), which leverages the concept of delayed response to anticipate distribution shifts and subsequently predicts targets accordingly. We provide theoretical insights suggesting that FPS can potentially lead to reduced generalization error. We conduct comprehensive experiments using multiple time-series models on COVID-19 and traffic forecasting tasks. The results demonstrate that FPS consistently outperforms conventional time-series forecasting methods, highlighting its efficacy in handling performativity-induced challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages (8 main text, 1 reference, 3 appendix), 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Diffusion Models for Tabular Data Imputation and Synthetic Data Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02549v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data imputation and data generation have important applications for many domains, like healthcare and finance, where incomplete or missing data can hinder accurate analysis and decision-making. Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models capable of capturing complex data distributions across various data modalities such as image, audio, and time series data. Recently, they have been also adapted to generate tabular data. In this paper, we propose a diffusion model for tabular data that introduces three key enhancements: (1) a conditioning attention mechanism, (2) an encoder-decoder transformer as the denoising network, and (3) dynamic masking. The conditioning attention mechanism is designed to improve the model's ability to capture the relationship between the condition and synthetic data. The transformer layers help model interactions within the condition (encoder) or synthetic data (decoder), while dynamic masking enables our model to efficiently handle both missing data imputation and synthetic data generation tasks within a unified framework. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation by comparing the performance of diffusion models with transformer conditioning against state-of-the-art techniques, such as Variational Autoencoders, Generative Adversarial Networks and Diffusion Models, on benchmark datasets. Our evaluation focuses on the assessment of the generated samples with respect to three important criteria, namely: (1) Machine Learning efficiency, (2) statistical similarity, and (3) privacy risk mitigation. For the task of data imputation, we consider the efficiency of the generated samples across different levels of missing features.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

This review synthesizes recent progress in applying autoencoders and vision transformers for unsupervised signal analysis, focusing on their architectures, applications, and emerging trends. We explore how these models enable feature extraction, anomaly detection, and classification across diverse signal types, including electrocardiograms, radar waveforms, and IoT sensor data. The review highlights the strengths of hybrid architectures and self-supervised learning, while identifying challenges in interpretability, scalability, and domain generalization. By bridging methodological innovations and practical applications, this work offers a roadmap for developing robust, adaptive models for signal intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Early Detection of Patient Deterioration from Real-Time Wearable Monitoring System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01305v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early detection of patient deterioration is crucial for reducing mortality rates. Heart rate data has shown promise in assessing patient health, and wearable devices offer a cost-effective solution for real-time monitoring. However, extracting meaningful insights from diverse heart rate data and handling missing values in wearable device data remain key challenges. To address these challenges, we propose TARL, an innovative approach that models the structural relationships of representative subsequences, known as shapelets, in heart rate time series. TARL creates a shapelet-transition knowledge graph to model shapelet dynamics in heart rate time series, indicating illness progression and potential future changes. We further introduce a transition-aware knowledge embedding to reinforce relationships among shapelets and quantify the impact of missing values, enabling the formulation of comprehensive heart rate representations. These representations capture explanatory structures and predict future heart rate trends, aiding early illness detection. We collaborate with physicians and nurses to gather ICU patient heart rate data from wearables and diagnostic metrics assessing illness severity for evaluating deterioration. Experiments on real-world ICU data demonstrate that TARL achieves both high reliability and early detection. A case study further showcases TARL's explainable detection process, highlighting its potential as an AI-driven tool to assist clinicians in recognizing early signs of patient deterioration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-time respiratory motion forecasting with online learning of recurrent neural networks for accurate targeting in externally guided radiotherapy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01607v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In lung radiotherapy, infrared cameras can track reflective objects on the chest to estimate tumor motion due to breathing, but treatment system latencies hinder radiation beam precision. Real-time recurrent learning (RTRL) is a potential solution that can learn patterns within non-stationary respiratory data but has high complexity. This study assesses the capabilities of resource-efficient online RNN algorithms, namely unbiased online recurrent optimization (UORO), sparse-1 step approximation (SnAp-1), and decoupled neural interfaces (DNI) to forecast respiratory motion during radiotherapy treatment accurately. We use time series containing the 3D positions of external markers on the chest of healthy subjects. We propose efficient implementations for SnAp-1 and DNI that compress the influence and immediate Jacobian matrices and accurately update the linear coefficients used in credit assignment estimation, respectively. Data was originally sampled at 10Hz; we resampled it at 3.33Hz and 30Hz to analyze the effect of the sampling rate on performance. We use UORO, SnAp-1, and DNI to forecast each marker's 3D position with horizons h<=2.1s (the time interval in advance for which the prediction is made) and compare them with RTRL, least mean squares, kernel support vector regression, and linear regression. RNNs trained online achieved similar or better accuracy than most previous works using larger training databases and deep learning, even though we used only the first minute of each sequence to predict motion within that exact sequence. SnAp-1 had the lowest normalized root mean square errors (nRMSEs) averaged over the horizon values considered, equal to 0.335 and 0.157, at 3.33Hz and 10.0Hz, respectively. Similarly, UORO had the lowest nRMSE at 30Hz, equal to 0.086. DNI's inference time (6.8ms per time step at 30Hz, Intel Core i7-13700 CPU) was the lowest among the RNN methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 18 figures, accepted manuscript version</p></details> |
| **[Stock Market Telepathy: Graph Neural Networks Predicting the Secret Conversations between MINT and G7 Countries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01945v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emerging economies, particularly the MINT countries (Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria, and T\"urkiye), are gaining influence in global stock markets, although they remain susceptible to the economic conditions of developed countries like the G7 (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States). This interconnectedness and sensitivity of financial markets make understanding these relationships crucial for investors and policymakers to predict stock price movements accurately. To this end, we examined the main stock market indices of G7 and MINT countries from 2012 to 2024, using a recent graph neural network (GNN) algorithm called multivariate time series forecasting with graph neural network (MTGNN). This method allows for considering complex spatio-temporal connections in multivariate time series. In the implementations, MTGNN revealed that the US and Canada are the most influential G7 countries regarding stock indices in the forecasting process, and Indonesia and T\"urkiye are the most influential MINT countries. Additionally, our results showed that MTGNN outperformed traditional methods in forecasting the prices of stock market indices for MINT and G7 countries. Consequently, the study offers valuable insights into economic blocks' markets and presents a compelling empirical approach to analyzing global stock market dynamics using MTGNN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trojan Horse Hunt in Time Series Forecasting for Space Operations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01849v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This competition hosted on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/trojan-horse-hunt-in-space) is the first part of a series of follow-up competitions and hackathons related to the "Assurance for Space Domain AI Applications" project funded by the European Space Agency (https://assurance-ai.space-codev.org/). The competition idea is based on one of the real-life AI security threats identified within the project -- the adversarial poisoning of continuously fine-tuned satellite telemetry forecasting models. The task is to develop methods for finding and reconstructing triggers (trojans) in advanced models for satellite telemetry forecasting used in safety-critical space operations. Participants are provided with 1) a large public dataset of real-life multivariate satellite telemetry (without triggers), 2) a reference model trained on the clean data, 3) a set of poisoned neural hierarchical interpolation (N-HiTS) models for time series forecasting trained on the dataset with injected triggers, and 4) Jupyter notebook with the training pipeline and baseline algorithm (the latter will be published in the last month of the competition). The main task of the competition is to reconstruct a set of 45 triggers (i.e., short multivariate time series segments) injected into the training data of the corresponding set of 45 poisoned models. The exact characteristics (i.e., shape, amplitude, and duration) of these triggers must be identified by participants. The popular Neural Cleanse method is adopted as a baseline, but it is not designed for time series analysis and new approaches are necessary for the task. The impact of the competition is not limited to the space domain, but also to many other safety-critical applications of advanced time series analysis where model poisoning may lead to serious consequences.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ergodic Network Stochastic Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17779v3)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel framework for Network Stochastic Differential Equations (N-SDE), where each node in a network is governed by an SDE influenced by interactions with its neighbors. The evolution of each node is driven by the interplay of three key components: the node's intrinsic dynamics (\emph{momentum effect}), feedback from neighboring nodes (\emph{network effect}), and a \emph{stochastic volatility} term modeled by Brownian motion. Our primary objective is to estimate the parameters of the N-SDE system from high-frequency discrete-time observations. The motivation behind this model lies in its ability to analyze very high-dimensional time series by leveraging the inherent sparsity of the underlying network graph. We consider two distinct scenarios: \textit{i) known network structure}: the graph is fully specified, and we establish conditions under which the parameters can be identified, considering the linear growth of the parameter space with the number of edges. \textit{ii) unknown network structure}: the graph must be inferred from the data. For this, we develop an iterative procedure using adaptive Lasso, tailored to a specific subclass of N-SDE models. In this work, we assume the network graph is oriented, paving the way for novel applications of SDEs in causal inference, enabling the study of cause-effect relationships in dynamic systems. Through extensive simulation studies, we demonstrate the performance of our estimators across various graph topologies in high-dimensional settings. We also showcase the framework's applicability to real-world datasets, highlighting its potential for advancing the analysis of complex networked systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Gaussian Mixture Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01780v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces FedGenGMM, a novel one-shot federated learning approach for Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) tailored for unsupervised learning scenarios. In federated learning (FL), where multiple decentralized clients collaboratively train models without sharing raw data, significant challenges include statistical heterogeneity, high communication costs, and privacy concerns. FedGenGMM addresses these issues by allowing local GMM models, trained independently on client devices, to be aggregated through a single communication round. This approach leverages the generative property of GMMs, enabling the creation of a synthetic dataset on the server side to train a global model efficiently. Evaluation across diverse datasets covering image, tabular, and time series data demonstrates that FedGenGMM consistently achieves performance comparable to non-federated and iterative federated methods, even under significant data heterogeneity. Additionally, FedGenGMM significantly reduces communication overhead, maintains robust performance in anomaly detection tasks, and offers flexibility in local model complexities, making it particularly suitable for edge computing environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 6 figures.

However, the current landscape of DA in TSC is plagued with fragmented literature reviews, nebulous methodological taxonomies, inadequate evaluative measures, and a dearth of accessible and user-oriented tools. This study addresses these challenges through a comprehensive examination of DA methodologies within the TSC domain.Our research began with an extensive literature review spanning a decade, revealing significant gaps in existing surveys and necessitating a detailed analysis of over 100 scholarly articles to identify more than 60 distinct DA techniques. This rigorous review led to the development of a novel taxonomy tailored to the specific needs of DA in TSC, categorizing techniques into five primary categories: Transformation-Based, Pattern-Based, Generative, Decomposition-Based, and Automated Data Augmentation. This taxonomy is intended to guide researchers in selecting appropriate methods with greater clarity. In response to the lack of comprehensive evaluations of foundational DA techniques, we conducted a thorough empirical study, testing nearly 20 DA strategies across 15 diverse datasets representing all types within the UCR time-series repository. Using ResNet and LSTM architectures, we employed a multifaceted evaluation approach, including metrics such as Accuracy, Method Ranking, and Residual Analysis, resulting in a benchmark accuracy of 84.98 +- 16.41% in ResNet and 82.41 +- 18.71% in LSTM. Our investigation underscored the inconsistent efficacies of DA techniques, for instance, methods like RGWs and Random Permutation significantly improved model performance, whereas others, like EMD, were less effective.</p></details> |  |

Such characteristics align closely with the demands of ubiquitous computing systems, which often operate on resource-constrained devices while continuously monitoring and processing time-series sensor data. Despite their unique and promising features, SNNs have received limited attention and remain underexplored (or at least, under-adopted) within the ubiquitous computing community. To address this gap, this paper first introduces the core components of SNNs, both in terms of models and training mechanisms. It then presents a systematic survey of 76 SNN-based studies focused on time-series data analysis, categorizing them into six key application domains. For each domain, we summarize relevant works and subsequent advancements, distill core insights, and highlight key takeaways for researchers and practitioners. To facilitate hands-on experimentation, we also provide a comprehensive review of current software frameworks and neuromorphic hardware platforms, detailing their capabilities and specifications, and then offering tailored recommendations for selecting development tools based on specific application needs. Finally, we identify prevailing challenges within each application domain and propose future research directions that need be explored in ubiquitous community. Our survey highlights the transformative potential of SNNs in enabling energy-efficient ubiquitous sensing across diverse application domains, while also serving as an essential introduction for researchers looking to enter this emerging field.</p></details> | 50 pages |

While prior work targeting Microcontroller Units (MCUs) has explored hardware-specific optimizations, such approaches are often task-specific and limited to 8-bit fixed-point precision. Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offer greater flexibility, enabling fine-grained control over data precision and architecture. However, existing FPGA-based deployments of Transformers for time-series analysis typically focus on high-density platforms with manual configuration. This paper presents a unified and fully automated deployment framework for Tiny Transformers on embedded FPGAs. Our framework supports a compact encoder-only Transformer architecture across three representative time-series tasks (forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection). It combines quantization-aware training (down to 4 bits), hardware-aware hyperparameter search using Optuna, and automatic VHDL generation for seamless deployment. We evaluate our framework on six public datasets across two embedded FPGA platforms. Results show that our framework produces integer-only, task-specific Transformer accelerators achieving as low as 0.033 mJ per inference with millisecond latency on AMD Spartan-7, while also providing insights into deployment feasibility on Lattice iCE40.

| **[An Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Model for High-Dimensional Tensor-Valued Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01658v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In autoregressive modeling for tensor-valued time series, Tucker decomposition, when applied to the coefficient tensor, provides a clear interpretation of supervised factor modeling but loses its efficiency rapidly with increasing tensor order. Conversely, canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition maintains efficiency but lacks a precise statistical interpretation. To attain both interpretability and powerful dimension reduction, this paper proposes a novel approach under the supervised factor modeling paradigm, which first uses CP decomposition to extract response and covariate features separately and then regresses response features on covariate ones. This leads to a new CP-based low-rank structure for the coefficient tensor. Furthermore, to address heterogeneous signals or potential model misspecifications arising from stringent low-rank assumptions, a low-rank plus sparse model is introduced by incorporating an additional sparse coefficient tensor. Nonasymptotic properties are established for the ordinary least squares estimators, and an alternating least squares algorithm is introduced for optimization. Theoretical properties of the proposed methodology are validated by simulation studies, and its enhanced prediction performance and interpretability are demonstrated by the El Ni$\tilde{\text{n}}$o-Southern Oscillation example.</p></details> |  |

By integrating implicit neural representations with latent variable models, TV-INRs learn distributions over time-continuous generator functions conditioned on signal-specific covariates. Unlike existing approaches that require extensive training, fine-tuning or meta-learning, our method achieves accurate individualized predictions through a single forward pass. Our experiments demonstrate that with a single TV-INRs instance, we can accurately solve diverse imputation and forecasting tasks, offering a computationally efficient and scalable solution for real-world applications. TV-INRs excel especially in low-data regimes, where it outperforms existing methods by an order of magnitude in mean squared error for imputation task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Causal-based Simulation for Realistic Time-series Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02084v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal Discovery plays a pivotal role in revealing relationships among observed variables, particularly in the temporal setup. While the majority of CD methods rely on synthetic data for evaluation, and recently for training, these fall short in accurately mirroring real-world scenarios; an effect even more evident in temporal data. Generation techniques depending on simplified assumptions on causal structure, effects and time, limit the quality and diversity of the simulated data. In this work, we introduce Temporal Causal-based Simulation (TCS), a robust framework for generating realistic time-series data and their associated temporal causal graphs. The approach is structured in three phases: estimating the true lagged causal structure of the data, approximating the functional dependencies between variables and learning the noise distribution of the corresponding causal model, each part of which can be explicitly tailored based on data assumptions and characteristics. Through an extensive evaluation process, we highlight that single detection methods for generated data discrimination prove inadequate, accentuating it as a multifaceted challenge. For this, we detail a Min-max optimization phase that draws on AutoML techniques. Our contributions include a flexible, model-agnostic pipeline for generating realistic temporal causal data, a thorough evaluation setup which enhances the validity of the generated datasets and insights into the challenges posed by realistic data generation. Through experiments involving not only real but also semi-synthetic and purely synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that while sampling realistic causal data remains a complex task, our method enriches the domain of generating sensible causal-based temporal data.</p></details> | 22 pages, 3 figures |
| **[RATFM: Retrieval-augmented Time Series Foundation Model for Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02081v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing, recent research has explored the building of time series foundation models and applied them to tasks such as forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection. However, their performances vary between different domains and tasks. In LLM-based approaches, test-time adaptation using example-based prompting has become common, owing to the high cost of retraining. In the context of anomaly detection, which is the focus of this study, providing normal examples from the target domain can also be effective. However, time series foundation models do not naturally acquire the ability to interpret or utilize examples or instructions, because the nature of time series data used during training does not encourage such capabilities. To address this limitation, we propose a retrieval augmented time series foundation model (RATFM), which enables pretrained time series foundation models to incorporate examples of test-time adaptation. We show that RATFM achieves a performance comparable to that of in-domain fine-tuning while avoiding domain-dependent fine-tuning. Experiments on the UCR Anomaly Archive, a multi-domain dataset including nine domains, confirms the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[ShaTS: A Shapley-based Explainability Method for Time Series Artificial Intelligence Models applied to Anomaly Detection in Industrial Internet of Things](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01450v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial Internet of Things environments increasingly rely on advanced Anomaly Detection and explanation techniques to rapidly detect and mitigate cyberincidents, thereby ensuring operational safety. The sequential nature of data collected from these environments has enabled improvements in Anomaly Detection using Machine Learning and Deep Learning models by processing time windows rather than treating the data as tabular. However, conventional explanation methods often neglect this temporal structure, leading to imprecise or less actionable explanations. This work presents ShaTS (Shapley values for Time Series models), which is a model-agnostic explainable Artificial Intelligence method designed to enhance the precision of Shapley value explanations for time series models. ShaTS addresses the shortcomings of traditional approaches by incorporating an a priori feature grouping strategy that preserves temporal dependencies and produces both coherent and actionable insights. Experiments conducted on the SWaT dataset demonstrate that ShaTS accurately identifies critical time instants, precisely pinpoints the sensors, actuators, and processes affected by anomalies, and outperforms SHAP in terms of both explainability and resource efficiency, fulfilling the real-time requirements of industrial environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages;16 figures;Submitted to Elsevier (Information Fusion)</p></details> |
| **[High-Dimensional Regularized Additive Matrix Autoregressive Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01403v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional time series has diverse applications in econometrics and finance. Recent models for capturing temporal dependence have employed a bilinear representation for matrix time series, or the Tucker-decomposition based representation in case of tensor time series. A bilinear or Tucker-decomposition based temporal effect is difficult to interpret on many occasions, along with its computational complexity due to the non-convex nature of the underlying optimization problem. Moreover, the existing matrix case models have not sufficiently explored the possibilities of imposing any lower-dimensional pattern on the transition matrices. In this work, we propose a regularized additive matrix autoregressive model with additive interaction of row-wise and column-wise temporal dependence, that offers more interpretability, less computational burden due to its convex nature and estimation of the underlying low rank plus sparse pattern of its transition matrices. We address the issue of identifiability of the various components in our model and subsequently develop a scalable Alternating Block Minimization algorithm for estimating the parameters. We provide a finite sample error bound under high-dimensional scaling for the model parameters. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed model is demonstrated on synthetic and real data.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeGraph: Synthetic Benchmark Datasets for Robust Time-Series Causal Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01361v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust causal discovery in time series datasets depends on reliable benchmark datasets with known ground-truth causal relationships. However, such datasets remain scarce, and existing synthetic alternatives often overlook critical temporal properties inherent in real-world data, including nonstationarity driven by trends and seasonality, irregular sampling intervals, and the presence of unobserved confounders. To address these challenges, we introduce TimeGraph, a comprehensive suite of synthetic time-series benchmark datasets that systematically incorporates both linear and nonlinear dependencies while modeling key temporal characteristics such as trends, seasonal effects, and heterogeneous noise patterns. Each dataset is accompanied by a fully specified causal graph featuring varying densities and diverse noise distributions and is provided in two versions: one including unobserved confounders and one without, thereby offering extensive coverage of real-world complexity while preserving methodological neutrality. We further demonstrate the utility of TimeGraph through systematic evaluations of state-of-the-art causal discovery algorithms including PCMCI+, LPCMCI, and FGES across a diverse array of configurations and metrics. Our experiments reveal significant variations in algorithmic performance under realistic temporal conditions, underscoring the need for robust synthetic benchmarks in the fair and transparent assessment of causal discovery methods. The complete TimeGraph suite, including dataset generation scripts, evaluation metrics, and recommended experimental protocols, is freely available to facilitate reproducible research and foster community-driven advancements in time-series causal discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, accepted at KDD 2025 (Datasets and Benchmarks Track)</p></details> |
| **[MADCluster: Model-agnostic Anomaly Detection with Self-supervised Clustering Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16223v4)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose MADCluster, a novel model-agnostic anomaly detection framework utilizing self-supervised clustering. MADCluster is applicable to various deep learning architectures and addresses the 'hypersphere collapse' problem inherent in existing deep learning-based anomaly detection methods. The core idea is to cluster normal pattern data into a 'single cluster' while simultaneously learning the cluster center and mapping data close to this center. Also, to improve expressiveness and enable effective single clustering, we propose a new 'One-directed Adaptive loss'. The optimization of this loss is mathematically proven. MADCluster consists of three main components: Base Embedder capturing high-dimensional temporal dynamics, Cluster Distance Mapping, and Sequence-wise Clustering for continuous center updates. Its model-agnostic characteristics are achieved by applying various architectures to the Base Embedder. Experiments on four time series benchmark datasets demonstrate that applying MADCluster improves the overall performance of comparative models. In conclusion, the compatibility of MADCluster shows potential for enhancing model performance across various architectures.</p></details> | 24 pages, 9 figures |

Future public health efforts must attempt to understand such content, what concerns it may raise among readers, and how to effectively respond to it. To this end, we present ConcernScope, a platform that uses a teacher-student framework for knowledge transfer between large language models and light-weight classifiers to quickly and effectively identify the health concerns raised in a text corpus. The platform allows uploading massive files directly, automatically scraping specific URLs, and direct text editing. ConcernScope is built on top of a taxonomy of public health concerns. Intended for public health officials, we demonstrate several applications of this platform: guided data exploration to find useful examples of common concerns found in online community datasets, identification of trends in concerns through an example time series analysis of 186,000 samples, and finding trends in topic frequency before and after significant events.</p></details> | 19 pages, 15 figures |
| **[TSRating: Rating Quality of Diverse Time Series Data by Meta-learning from LLM Judgment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01290v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality time series (TS) data are essential for ensuring TS model performance, rendering research on rating TS data quality indispensable. Existing methods have shown promising rating accuracy within individual domains, primarily by extending data quality rating techniques such as influence functions and Shapley values to account for temporal characteristics. However, they neglect the fact that real-world TS data can span vastly different domains and exhibit distinct properties, hampering the accurate and efficient rating of diverse TS data. In this paper, we propose TSRating, a novel and unified framework for rating the quality of time series data crawled from diverse domains. TSRating is built on the assumption that LLMs inherit ample knowledge, acquired during their extensive pretraining, enabling them to comprehend and discern quality differences in diverse TS data. We verify this assumption by devising a series of prompts to elicit quality comparisons from LLMs for pairs of TS samples. We then fit a dedicated rating model, termed TSRater, to convert the LLMs' judgments into efficient quality predictions via TSRater's inference on future TS samples. To ensure cross-domain adaptability, we develop a meta-learning scheme to train TSRater on quality comparisons collected from nine distinct domains. To improve training efficiency, we employ signSGD for inner-loop updates, thus circumventing the demanding computation of hypergradients. Extensive experimental results on eleven benchmark datasets across three time series tasks, each using both conventional TS models and TS foundation models, demonstrate that TSRating outperforms baselines in terms of estimation accuracy, efficiency, and domain adaptability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Weight-Space Linear Recurrent Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01153v1)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce WARP (Weight-space Adaptive Recurrent Prediction), a simple yet powerful framework that unifies weight-space learning with linear recurrence to redefine sequence modeling. Unlike conventional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) which collapse temporal dynamics into fixed-dimensional hidden states, WARP explicitly parametrizes the hidden state as the weights of a distinct root neural network. This formulation promotes higher-resolution memory, gradient-free adaptation at test-time, and seamless integration of domain-specific physical priors. Empirical validation shows that WARP matches or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on diverse classification tasks, spanning synthetic benchmarks to real-world datasets. Furthermore, extensive experiments across sequential image completion, dynamical system reconstruction, and multivariate time series forecasting demonstrate its expressiveness and generalization capabilities. Critically, WARP's weight trajectories offer valuable insights into the model's inner workings. Ablation studies confirm the architectural necessity of key components, solidifying weight-space linear RNNs as a transformative paradigm for adaptive machine intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 21 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |

Classical time series classification and deep learning techniques have demonstrated limited efficacy in monitoring PD symptoms using wearable accelerometer data due to complex PD movement patterns and the small size of available datasets. We investigate InceptionTime and RandOm Convolutional KErnel Transform (ROCKET) as they are promising for PD symptom monitoring. InceptionTime's high learning capacity is well-suited to modeling complex movement patterns, while ROCKET is suited to small datasets. With random search methodology, we identify the highest-scoring InceptionTime architecture and compare its performance to ROCKET with a ridge classifier and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) on wrist motion data from PD patients. Our findings indicate that all approaches can learn to estimate tremor severity and bradykinesia presence with moderate performance but encounter challenges in detecting dyskinesia. Among the presented approaches, ROCKET demonstrates higher scores in identifying dyskinesia, whereas InceptionTime exhibits slightly better performance in tremor and bradykinesia estimation. Notably, both methods outperform the multi-layer perceptron. In conclusion, InceptionTime can classify complex wrist motion time series and holds potential for continuous symptom monitoring in PD with further development.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The source code is available from https://github.com/cedricdonie/tsc-for-wrist-motion-pd-detection</p></details> |
| **[Language in the Flow of Time: Time-Series-Paired Texts Weaved into a Unified Temporal Narrative](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08942v2)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While many advances in time series models focus exclusively on numerical data, research on multimodal time series, particularly those involving contextual textual information commonly encountered in real-world scenarios, remains in its infancy. With recent progress in large language models and time series learning, we revisit the integration of paired texts with time series through the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, which posits that representations of different modalities converge to shared spaces. In this context, we identify that time-series-paired texts may naturally exhibit periodic properties that closely mirror those of the original time series. Building on this insight, we propose a novel framework, Texts as Time Series (TaTS), which considers the time-series-paired texts to be auxiliary variables of the time series. TaTS can be plugged into any existing numerical-only time series models and enable them to handle time series data with paired texts effectively. Through extensive experiments on both multimodal time series forecasting and imputation tasks across benchmark datasets with various existing time series models, we demonstrate that TaTS can enhance predictive performance without modifying model architectures.

| **[Quantum Adaptive Self-Attention for Quantum Transformer Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05336v2)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer models have revolutionized sequential learning across various domains, yet their self-attention mechanism incurs quadratic computational cost, posing limitations for real-time and resource-constrained tasks. To address this, we propose Quantum Adaptive Self-Attention (QASA), a novel hybrid architecture that enhances classical Transformer models with a quantum attention mechanism. QASA replaces dot-product attention with a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) that adaptively captures inter-token relationships in the quantum Hilbert space. Additionally, a residual quantum projection module is introduced before the feedforward network to further refine temporal features. Our design retains classical efficiency in earlier layers while injecting quantum expressiveness in the final encoder block, ensuring compatibility with current NISQ hardware. Experiments on synthetic time-series tasks demonstrate that QASA achieves faster convergence and superior generalization compared to both standard Transformers and reduced classical variants. Preliminary complexity analysis suggests potential quantum advantages in gradient computation, opening new avenues for efficient quantum deep learning models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Fixed Variables: Expanding-variate Time Series Forecasting via Flat Scheme and Spatio-temporal Focal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15296v2)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF) has long been a key research focus. Traditionally, these studies assume a fixed number of variables, but in real-world applications, Cyber-Physical Systems often expand as new sensors are deployed, increasing variables in MTSF. In light of this, we introduce a novel task, Expanding-variate Time Series Forecasting (EVTSF). This task presents unique challenges, specifically (1) handling inconsistent data shapes caused by adding new variables, and (2) addressing imbalanced spatio-temporal learning, where expanding variables have limited observed data due to the necessity for timely operation. To address these challenges, we propose STEV, a flexible spatio-temporal forecasting framework. STEV includes a new Flat Scheme to tackle the inconsistent data shape issue, which extends the graph-based spatio-temporal modeling architecture into 1D space by flattening the 2D samples along the variable dimension, making the model variable-scale-agnostic while still preserving dynamic spatial correlations through a holistic graph. We introduce a novel Spatio-temporal Focal Learning strategy that incorporates a negative filter to resolve potential conflicts between contrastive learning and graph representation, and a focal contrastive loss as its core to guide the framework to focus on optimizing the expanding variables. We benchmark EVTSF performance using three real-world datasets and compare it against three potential solutions employing SOTA MTSF models tailored for EVSTF. Experimental results show that STEV significantly outperforms its competitors, particularly on expanding variables. Notably, STEV, with only 5% of observations from the expanding period, is on par with SOTA MTSF models trained with complete observations. Further exploration of various expanding strategies underscores the generalizability of STEV in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

On the objective side, we develop a machine learning model trained on mean opinion scores (MOS) computed via the ITU-T P.1203 reference implementation, allowing accurate prediction of user-perceived video quality using only network parameters such as packet loss, delay, jitter, and throughput without reliance on video content or client-side instrumentation. On the subjective side, we present a semantic filtering and scoring pipeline that processes user comments from live streams to extract performance-related feedback. A large language model is used to assign scalar MOS scores to filtered comments in a deterministic and reproducible manner. To support scalable and interpretable analysis, we construct a labeled dataset of 47,894 live-stream comments, of which about 34,000 are identified as QoE-relevant through multi-layer semantic filtering. Each comment is enriched with simulated Internet Service Provider attribution and temporally aligned using synthetic timestamps in 5-min intervals. The resulting dataset enables operator-level aggregation and time-series analysis of user-perceived quality. A delta MOS metric is proposed to measure each Internet service provider's deviation from platform-wide sentiment, allowing detection of localized degradations even in the absence of direct network telemetry. A controlled outage simulation confirms the framework's effectiveness in identifying service disruptions through comment-based trends alone. The system provides each operator with its own subjective MOS and the global platform average per interval, enabling real-time interpretation of performance deviations and comparison with objective network-based QoE estimates.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pp...</summary><p>19 ppages, 13 figures</p></details> |

This study presents LLM-Mixer, a framework that improves forecasting accuracy through the combination of multiscale time-series decomposition with pre-trained LLMs (Large Language Models). LLM-Mixer captures both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends by decomposing the data into multiple temporal resolutions and processing them with a frozen LLM, guided by a textual prompt specifically designed for time-series data. Extensive experiments conducted on multivariate and univariate datasets demonstrate that LLM-Mixer achieves competitive performance, outperforming recent state-of-the-art models across various forecasting horizons. This work highlights the potential of combining multiscale analysis and LLMs for effective and scalable time-series forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Time ...</summary><p>Time series forecasting using LLMs</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing LLM Reasoning for Time Series Classification by Tailored Thinking and Fused Decision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00807v1)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced their performance by enabling in-depth understanding of diverse tasks. With growing interest in applying LLMs to the time series domain, this has proven nontrivial, as evidenced by the limited efficacy of straightforwardly adapting text-domain reasoning techniques. Although recent work has shown promise in several time series tasks, further leveraging advancements in LLM reasoning remains under-explored for time series classification (TSC) tasks, despite their prevalence and significance in many real-world applications. In this paper, we propose ReasonTSC, a novel framework designed to effectively leverage LLM reasoning for time series classification through both a multi-turn reasoning and a fused decision-making strategy tailored to TSC. Rather than straightforwardly applying existing reasoning techniques or relying solely on LLMs' built-in reasoning capabilities, ReasonTSC first steers the model to think over the essential characteristics of time series data. Next, it integrates predictions and confidence scores from plug-in classifiers, e.g., domain-specific time series models, as in-context examples. Finally, ReasonTSC guides the LLM through a structured reasoning process: it evaluates the initial assessment, backtracks to consider alternative hypotheses, and compares their merits before arriving at a final classification. Extensive experiments and systematic ablation studies demonstrate that ReasonTSC consistently outperforms both existing time series reasoning baselines and plug-in models, and is even capable of identifying and correcting plug-in models' false predictions.</p></details> |  |

However, accurately forecasting STTS is challenging due to complex dynamic correlations in both time and space dimensions. Existing graph neural networks struggle to balance effectiveness and efficiency in modeling dynamic spatio-temporal relations. To address this problem, we propose the Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Stiefel Graph Neural Network (DST-SGNN) to efficiently process STTS. For DST-SGNN, we first introduce the novel Stiefel Graph Spectral Convolution (SGSC) and Stiefel Graph Fourier Transform (SGFT). The SGFT matrix in SGSC is constrained to lie on the Stiefel manifold, and SGSC can be regarded as a filtered graph spectral convolution. We also propose the Linear Dynamic Graph Optimization on Stiefel Manifold (LDGOSM), which can efficiently learn the SGFT matrix from the dynamic graph and significantly reduce the computational complexity. Finally, we propose a multi-layer SGSC (MSGSC) that efficiently captures complex spatio-temporal correlations. Extensive experiments on seven spatio-temporal datasets show that DST-SGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods while maintaining relatively low computational costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IJCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Distances between finite-horizon linear behaviors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22849v2)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The paper introduces a class of distances for linear behaviors over finite time horizons. These distances allow for comparisons between finite-horizon linear behaviors represented by matrices of possibly different dimensions. They remain invariant under coordinate changes, rotations, and permutations, ensuring independence from input-output partitions. Moreover, they naturally encode complexity-misfit trade-offs for Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) behaviors, providing a principled solution to a longstanding puzzle in behavioral systems theory. The resulting framework characterizes modeling as a minimum distance problem, identifying the Most Powerful Unfalsified Model (MPUM) as optimal among all systems unfalsified by a given dataset. Finally, we illustrate the value of these metrics in a time series anomaly detection task, where their finer resolution yields superior performance over existing distances.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Control Systems Letters / 64th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control</p></details> |

However, reproducible benchmarks with sufficient spatiotemporal depth and contextual richness for long horizon prediction remain scarce. To address this, we introduce HouseTS a large scale, multimodal dataset covering monthly house prices from March 2012 to December 2023 across 6,000 ZIP codes in 30 major U.S. metropolitan areas. The dataset includes over 890K records, enriched with points of Interest (POI), socioeconomic indicators, and detailed real estate metrics. To establish standardized performance baselines, we evaluate 14 models, spanning classical statistical approaches, deep neural networks (DNNs), and pretrained time-series foundation models. We further demonstrate the value of HouseTS in a multimodal case study, where a vision language model extracts structured textual descriptions of geographic change from time stamped satellite imagery. This enables interpretable, grounded insights into urban evolution. HouseTS is hosted on Kaggle, while all preprocessing pipelines, benchmark code, and documentation are openly maintained on GitHub to ensure full reproducibility and easy adoption.</p></details> |  |
