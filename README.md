| **[CaPulse: Detecting Anomalies by Tuning in to the Causal Rhythms of Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04630v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection has garnered considerable attention across diverse domains. While existing methods often fail to capture the underlying mechanisms behind anomaly generation in time series data. In addition, time series anomaly detection often faces several data-related inherent challenges, i.e., label scarcity, data imbalance, and complex multi-periodicity. In this paper, we leverage causal tools and introduce a new causality-based framework, CaPulse, which tunes in to the underlying causal pulse of time series data to effectively detect anomalies. Concretely, we begin by building a structural causal model to decipher the generation processes behind anomalies. To tackle the challenges posed by the data, we propose Periodical Normalizing Flows with a novel mask mechanism and carefully designed periodical learners, creating a periodicity-aware, density-based anomaly detection approach. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that CaPulse consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving AUROC improvements of 3% to 17%, with enhanced interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network for Remaining Useful Life Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04336v3)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting Remaining Useful Life (RUL) plays a crucial role in the prognostics and health management of industrial systems that involve a variety of interrelated sensors. Given a constant stream of time series sensory data from such systems, deep learning models have risen to prominence at identifying complex, nonlinear temporal dependencies in these data. In addition to the temporal dependencies of individual sensors, spatial dependencies emerge as important correlations among these sensors, which can be naturally modelled by a temporal graph that describes time-varying spatial relationships. However, the majority of existing studies have relied on capturing discrete snapshots of this temporal graph, a coarse-grained approach that leads to loss of temporal information. Moreover, given the variety of heterogeneous sensors, it becomes vital that such inherent heterogeneity is leveraged for RUL prediction in temporal sensor graphs. To capture the nuances of the temporal and spatial relationships and heterogeneous characteristics in an interconnected graph of sensors, we introduce a novel model named Temporal and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (THGNN). Specifically, THGNN aggregates historical data from neighboring nodes to accurately capture the temporal dynamics and spatial correlations within the stream of sensor data in a fine-grained manner. Moreover, the model leverages Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to address the diversity of sensor types, significantly improving the model's capacity to learn the heterogeneity in the data sources. Finally, we have validated the effectiveness of our approach through comprehensive experiments. Our empirical findings demonstrate significant advancements on the N-CMAPSS dataset, achieving improvements of up to 19.2% and 31.6% in terms of two different evaluation metrics over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 14 pages |
| **[CauKer: classification time series foundation models can be pretrained on synthetic data only](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02879v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series foundation models (TSFMs) have recently gained significant attention due to their strong zero-shot capabilities and widespread real-world applications. Such models typically require a computationally costly pretraining on large-scale, carefully curated collections of real-world sequences. To allow for a sample-efficient pretraining of TSFMs, we propose CauKer, a novel algorithm designed to generate diverse, causally coherent synthetic time series with realistic trends, seasonality, and nonlinear interactions. CauKer combines Gaussian Process (GP) kernel composition with Structural Causal Models (SCM) to produce data for sample-efficient pretraining of state-of-the-art classification TSFMs having different architectures and following different pretraining approaches. Additionally, our experiments reveal that CauKer-generated datasets exhibit clear scaling laws for both dataset size (10K to 10M samples) and model capacity (1M to 783M parameters), unlike real-world datasets, which display irregular scaling behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[PRISM: Lightweight Multivariate Time-Series Classification through Symmetric Multi-Resolution Convolutional Layers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04503v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time-series classification is pivotal in domains ranging from wearable sensing to biomedical monitoring. Despite recent advances, Transformer- and CNN-based models often remain computationally heavy, offer limited frequency diversity, and require extensive parameter budgets. We propose PRISM (Per-channel Resolution-Informed Symmetric Module), a convolutional-based feature extractor that applies symmetric finite-impulse-response (FIR) filters at multiple temporal scales, independently per channel. This multi-resolution, per-channel design yields highly frequency-selective embeddings without any inter-channel convolutions, greatly reducing model size and complexity. Across human-activity, sleep-stage and biomedical benchmarks, PRISM, paired with lightweight classification heads, matches or outperforms leading CNN and Transformer baselines, while using roughly an order of magnitude fewer parameters and FLOPs. By uniting classical signal processing insights with modern deep learning, PRISM offers an accurate, resource-efficient solution for multivariate time-series classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Quantum and Classical Sequential Models for Urban Telecommunication Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04488v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we evaluate the performance of classical and quantum-inspired sequential models in forecasting univariate time series of incoming SMS activity (SMS-in) using the Milan Telecommunication Activity Dataset. Due to data completeness limitations, we focus exclusively on the SMS-in signal for each spatial grid cell. We compare five models, LSTM (baseline), Quantum LSTM (QLSTM), Quantum Adaptive Self-Attention (QASA), Quantum Receptance Weighted Key-Value (QRWKV), and Quantum Fast Weight Programmers (QFWP), under varying input sequence lengths (4, 8, 12, 16, 32 and 64). All models are trained to predict the next 10-minute SMS-in value based solely on historical values within a given sequence window. Our findings indicate that different models exhibit varying sensitivities to sequence length, suggesting that quantum enhancements are not universally advantageous. Rather, the effectiveness of quantum modules is highly dependent on the specific task and architectural design, reflecting inherent trade-offs among model size, parameterization strategies, and temporal modeling capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time Series Transformer-Based Modeling of Pavement Skid and Texture Deterioration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01842v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the deterioration of skid resistance and surface macrotexture following preventive maintenance using micro-milling techniques. Field data were collected from 31 asphalt pavement sections located across four climatic zones in Texas. The data encompasses a variety of surface types, milling depths, operational speeds, and drum configurations. A standardized data collection protocol was followed, with measurements taken before milling, immediately after treatment, and at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months post-treatment. Skid number and Mean Profile Depth (MPD) were used to evaluate surface friction and texture characteristics. The dataset was reformatted into a time-series structure with 930 observations, including contextual variables such as climatic zone, treatment parameters, and baseline surface condition. A comparative modeling framework was applied to predict the deterioration trends of both skid resistance and macrotexture over time. Eight regression models, including linear, tree-based, and ensemble methods, were evaluated alongside a time series transformer model. Results show that the transformer model achieved the highest prediction accuracy for skid resistance (R2 = 0.981), while Random Forest performing best for macrotexture prediction (R2 = 0.838). The findings indicate that the degradation of surface characteristics after preventive maintenance is nonlinear and influenced by a combination of environmental and operational factors. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of data-driven modeling in supporting transportation agencies with pavement performance forecasting and maintenance planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[VisionTS++: Cross-Modal Time Series Foundation Model with Continual Pre-trained Visual Backbones](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04379v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have revealed that vision models pre-trained on images can perform well in time series forecasting by reformulating forecasting as an image reconstruction task, suggesting their potential as universal time series foundation models. However, effective cross-modal transfer from vision to time series remains challenging due to three key discrepancies: (1) data-modality gap between structured, bounded image data and unbounded, heterogeneous time series; (2) multivariate-forecasting gap between standard RGB three-channel-based vision models and the need to model time series with arbitrary numbers of variates; and (3) probabilistic-forecasting gap between the deterministic output formats of most vision models and the requirement for uncertainty-aware probabilistic predictions. To bridge these gaps, we propose VisionTS++, a vision-model-based TSFM that performs continual pre-training on large-scale time series datasets, including 3 innovations: (1) a vision-model-based filtering mechanism to identify high-quality time series data, thereby mitigating modality gap and improving pre-training stability, (2) a colorized multivariate conversion method that transforms multivariate time series into multi-subfigure RGB images, capturing complex inter-variate dependencies; and (3) a multi-quantile forecasting approach using parallel reconstruction heads to generate forecasts of different quantile levels, thus more flexibly approximating arbitrary output distributions without restrictive prior distributional assumptions. Evaluated on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution TSF benchmarks, \model achieves SOTA results, outperforming specialized TSFMs by 6%-44% in MSE reduction and ranking first in 9 out of 12 probabilistic forecasting settings. Our work establishes a new paradigm for cross-modal knowledge transfer, advancing the development of universal TSFMs.</p></details> | 21 pages |
| **[CITRAS: Covariate-Informed Transformer for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24007v3)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In practical time series forecasting, covariates provide rich contextual information that can potentially enhance the forecast of target variables. Although some covariates extend into the future forecasting horizon (e.g., calendar events, discount schedules), most multivariate models fail to leverage this pivotal insight due to the length discrepancy with target variables. Additionally, capturing the dependency between target variables and covariates is non-trivial, as models must precisely reflect the local impact of covariates while also capturing global cross-variate dependencies. To overcome these challenges, we propose CITRAS, a decoder-only Transformer that flexibly leverages multiple targets, past covariates, and future covariates. While preserving strong autoregressive capabilities, CITRAS introduces two novel mechanisms in patch-wise cross-variate attention: Key-Value (KV) Shift and Attention Score Smoothing. KV Shift seamlessly incorporates future covariates into the forecasting of target variables based on their concurrent dependencies. Additionally, Attention Score Smoothing refines locally accurate patch-wise cross-variate dependencies into global variate-level dependencies by smoothing the past series of attention scores. Experimentally, CITRAS outperforms state-of-the-art models on thirteen real-world benchmarks from both covariate-informed and multivariate settings, demonstrating its versatile ability to leverage cross-variate and cross-time dependencies for improved forecasting accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submission under review</p></details> |
| **[Binaural Sound Event Localization and Detection Neural Network based on HRTF Localization Cues for Humanoid Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04333v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humanoid robots require simultaneous sound event type and direction estimation for situational awareness, but conventional two-channel input struggles with elevation estimation and front-back confusion. This paper proposes a binaural sound event localization and detection (BiSELD) neural network to address these challenges. BiSELDnet learns time-frequency patterns and head-related transfer function (HRTF) localization cues from binaural input features. A novel eight-channel binaural time-frequency feature (BTFF) is introduced, comprising left/right mel-spectrograms, V-maps, an interaural time difference (ITD) map (below 1.5 kHz), an interaural level difference (ILD) map (above 5 kHz with front-back asymmetry), and spectral cue (SC) maps (above 5 kHz for elevation). The effectiveness of BTFF was confirmed across omnidirectional, horizontal, and median planes. BiSELDnets, particularly one based on the efficient Trinity module, were implemented to output time series of direction vectors for each sound event class, enabling simultaneous detection and localization. Vector activation map (VAM) visualization was proposed to analyze network learning, confirming BiSELDnet's focus on the N1 notch frequency for elevation estimation. Comparative evaluations under urban background noise conditions demonstrated that the proposed BiSELD model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) SELD models with binaural input.</p></details> | 200 pages |
| **[T3Time: Tri-Modal Time Series Forecasting via Adaptive Multi-Head Alignment and Residual Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04251v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) seeks to model temporal dynamics among variables to predict future trends. Transformer-based models and large language models (LLMs) have shown promise due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies and patterns. However, current methods often rely on rigid inductive biases, ignore intervariable interactions, or apply static fusion strategies that limit adaptability across forecast horizons. These limitations create bottlenecks in capturing nuanced, horizon-specific relationships in time-series data. To solve this problem, we propose T3Time, a novel trimodal framework consisting of time, spectral, and prompt branches, where the dedicated frequency encoding branch captures the periodic structures along with a gating mechanism that learns prioritization between temporal and spectral features based on the prediction horizon. We also proposed a mechanism which adaptively aggregates multiple cross-modal alignment heads by dynamically weighting the importance of each head based on the features. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average reduction of 3.28% in MSE and 2.29% in MAE. Furthermore, it shows strong generalization in few-shot learning settings: with 5% training data, we see a reduction in MSE and MAE by 4.13% and 1.91%, respectively; and with 10% data, by 3.62% and 1.98% on average.

| **[DP-GPT4MTS: Dual-Prompt Large Language Model for Textual-Numerical Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04239v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is crucial in strategic planning and decision-making across various industries. Traditional forecasting models mainly concentrate on numerical time series data, often overlooking important textual information such as events and news, which can significantly affect forecasting accuracy. While large language models offer a promise for integrating multimodal data, existing single-prompt frameworks struggle to effectively capture the semantics of timestamped text, introducing redundant information that can hinder model performance. To address this limitation, we introduce DP-GPT4MTS (Dual-Prompt GPT2-base for Multimodal Time Series), a novel dual-prompt large language model framework that combines two complementary prompts: an explicit prompt for clear task instructions and a textual prompt for context-aware embeddings from time-stamped data. The tokenizer generates the explicit prompt while the embeddings from the textual prompt are refined through self-attention and feed-forward networks. Comprehensive experiments conducted on diverse textural-numerical time series datasets demonstrate that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in time series forecasting. This highlights the significance of incorporating textual context via a dual-prompt mechanism to achieve more accurate time series predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Empowering Time Series Forecasting with LLM-Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04231v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) powered agents have emerged as effective planners for Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) systems. While most existing AutoML approaches focus on automating feature engineering and model architecture search, recent studies in time series forecasting suggest that lightweight models can often achieve state-of-the-art performance. This observation led us to explore improving data quality, rather than model architecture, as a potentially fruitful direction for AutoML on time series data. We propose DCATS, a Data-Centric Agent for Time Series. DCATS leverages metadata accompanying time series to clean data while optimizing forecasting performance. We evaluated DCATS using four time series forecasting models on a large-scale traffic volume forecasting dataset. Results demonstrate that DCATS achieves an average 6% error reduction across all tested models and time horizons, highlighting the potential of data-centric approaches in AutoML for time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[UltraSTF: Ultra-Compact Model for Large-Scale Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20634v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal data, prevalent in real-world applications such as traffic monitoring, financial transactions, and ride-share demands, represents a specialized case of multivariate time series characterized by high dimensionality. This high dimensionality necessitates computationally efficient models and benefits from applying univariate forecasting approaches through channel-independent strategies. SparseTSF, a recently proposed competitive univariate forecasting model, leverages periodicity to achieve compactness by focusing on cross-period dynamics, extending the Pareto frontier in terms of model size and predictive performance. However, it underperforms on spatio-temporal data due to limited capture of intra-period temporal dependencies. To address this limitation, we propose UltraSTF, which integrates a cross-period forecasting component with an ultra-compact shape bank component. Our model efficiently captures recurring patterns in time series using the attention mechanism of the shape bank component, significantly enhancing its capability to learn intra-period dynamics. UltraSTF achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LargeST benchmark while utilizing fewer than 0.2% of the parameters required by the second-best methods, thereby further extending the Pareto frontier of existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[BadTime: An Effective Backdoor Attack on Multivariate Long-Term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04189v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate Long-Term Time Series Forecasting (MLTSF) models are increasingly deployed in critical domains such as climate, finance, and transportation. Although a variety of powerful MLTSF models have been proposed to improve predictive performance, the robustness of MLTSF models against malicious backdoor attacks remains entirely unexplored, which is crucial to ensuring their reliable and trustworthy deployment. To address this gap, we conduct an in-depth study on backdoor attacks against MLTSF models and propose the first effective attack method named BadTime. BadTime executes a backdoor attack by poisoning training data and customizing the backdoor training process. During data poisoning, BadTime proposes a contrast-guided strategy to select the most suitable training samples for poisoning, then employs a graph attention network to identify influential variables for trigger injection. Subsequently, BadTime further localizes optimal positions for trigger injection based on lag analysis and proposes a puzzle-like trigger structure that distributes the trigger across multiple poisoned variables to jointly steer the prediction of the target variable. During backdoor training, BadTime alternately optimizes the model and triggers via proposed tailored optimization objectives. Extensive experiments show that BadTime significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) backdoor attacks on time series forecasting by reducing MAE by over 50% on target variables and boosting stealthiness by more than 3 times.</p></details> |  |
| **[KFS: KAN based adaptive Frequency Selection learning architecture for long term time series forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00635v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-scale decomposition architectures have emerged as predominant methodologies in time series forecasting. However, real-world time series exhibit noise interference across different scales, while heterogeneous information distribution among frequency components at varying scales leads to suboptimal multi-scale representation. Inspired by Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) and Parseval's theorem, we propose a KAN based adaptive Frequency Selection learning architecture (KFS) to address these challenges. This framework tackles prediction challenges stemming from cross-scale noise interference and complex pattern modeling through its FreK module, which performs energy-distribution-based dominant frequency selection in the spectral domain. Simultaneously, KAN enables sophisticated pattern representation while timestamp embedding alignment synchronizes temporal representations across scales. The feature mixing module then fuses scale-specific patterns with aligned temporal features. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world time series datasets demonstrate that KT achieves state-of-the-art performance as a simple yet effective architecture.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2406.03751 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[From Entanglement to Alignment: Representation Space Decomposition for Unsupervised Time Series Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20968v3)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain shift poses a fundamental challenge in time series analysis, where models trained on source domain often fail dramatically when applied in target domain with different yet similar distributions. While current unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods attempt to align cross-domain feature distributions, they typically treat features as indivisible entities, ignoring their intrinsic compositions that govern domain adaptation. We introduce DARSD, a novel UDA framework with theoretical explainability that explicitly realizes UDA tasks from the perspective of representation space decomposition. Our core insight is that effective domain adaptation requires not just alignment, but principled disentanglement of transferable knowledge from mixed representations. DARSD consists of three synergistic components: (I) An adversarial learnable common invariant basis that projects original features into a domain-invariant subspace while preserving semantic content; (II) A prototypical pseudo-labeling mechanism that dynamically separates target features based on confidence, hindering error accumulation; (III) A hybrid contrastive optimization strategy that simultaneously enforces feature clustering and consistency while mitigating emerging distribution gaps. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four benchmarks (WISDM, HAR, HHAR, and MFD) demonstrate DARSD's superiority against 12 UDA algorithms, achieving optimal performance in 35 out of 53 scenarios and ranking first across all benchmarks.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |
| **[STARE: Predicting Decision Making Based on Spatio-Temporal Eye Movements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04148v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The present work proposes a Deep Learning architecture for the prediction of various consumer choice behaviors from time series of raw gaze or eye fixations on images of the decision environment, for which currently no foundational models are available. The architecture, called STARE (Spatio-Temporal Attention Representation for Eye Tracking), uses a new tokenization strategy, which involves mapping the x- and y- pixel coordinates of eye-movement time series on predefined, contiguous Regions of Interest. That tokenization makes the spatio-temporal eye-movement data available to the Chronos, a time-series foundation model based on the T5 architecture, to which co-attention and/or cross-attention is added to capture directional and/or interocular influences of eye movements. We compare STARE with several state-of-the art alternatives on multiple datasets with the purpose of predicting consumer choice behaviors from eye movements. We thus make a first step towards developing and testing DL architectures that represent visual attention dynamics rooted in the neurophysiology of eye movements.</p></details> |  |
| **[DMSC: Dynamic Multi-Scale Coordination Framework for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02753v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Forecasting (TSF) faces persistent challenges in modeling intricate temporal dependencies across different scales. Despite recent advances leveraging different decomposition operations and novel architectures based on CNN, MLP or Transformer, existing methods still struggle with static decomposition strategies, fragmented dependency modeling, and inflexible fusion mechanisms, limiting their ability to model intricate temporal dependencies. To explicitly solve the mentioned three problems respectively, we propose a novel Dynamic Multi-Scale Coordination Framework (DMSC) with Multi-Scale Patch Decomposition block (EMPD), Triad Interaction Block (TIB) and Adaptive Scale Routing MoE block (ASR-MoE). Specifically, EMPD is designed as a built-in component to dynamically segment sequences into hierarchical patches with exponentially scaled granularities, eliminating predefined scale constraints through input-adaptive patch adjustment. TIB then jointly models intra-patch, inter-patch, and cross-variable dependencies within each layer's decomposed representations. EMPD and TIB are jointly integrated into layers forming a multi-layer progressive cascade architecture, where coarse-grained representations from earlier layers adaptively guide fine-grained feature extraction in subsequent layers via gated pathways. And ASR-MoE dynamically fuses multi-scale predictions by leveraging specialized global and local experts with temporal-aware weighting. Comprehensive experiments on thirteen real-world benchmarks demonstrate that DMSC consistently maintains state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and superior computational efficiency for TSF tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/1327679995/DMSC.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time Evidence Fusion Network: Multi-source View in Long-Term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06419v4)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In practical scenarios, time series forecasting necessitates not only accuracy but also efficiency. Consequently, the exploration of model architectures remains a perennially trending topic in research. To address these challenges, we propose a novel backbone architecture named Time Evidence Fusion Network (TEFN) from the perspective of information fusion. Specifically, we introduce the Basic Probability Assignment (BPA) Module based on evidence theory to capture the uncertainty of multivariate time series data from both channel and time dimensions. Additionally, we develop a novel multi-source information fusion method to effectively integrate the two distinct dimensions from BPA output, leading to improved forecasting accuracy. Lastly, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that TEFN achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining significantly lower complexity and reduced training time. Also, our experiments show that TEFN exhibits high robustness, with minimal error fluctuations during hyperparameter selection. Furthermore, due to the fact that BPA is derived from fuzzy theory, TEFN offers a high degree of interpretability. Therefore, the proposed TEFN balances accuracy, efficiency, stability, and interpretability, making it a desirable solution for time series forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI), 2025</p></details> |

The SSI data constitute a matrix with spectrally (rows) and temporally (columns) resolved solar energy flux measurements. The most recent SSI measurements have been made by NASA's Total and Spectral Solar Irradiance Sensor-1 (TSIS-1) Spectral Irradiance Monitor (SIM) since March 2018. This data have considerable missing data due to both random factors and instrument downtime, a periodic trend related to the Sun's cyclical magnetic activity, and varying degrees of correlation among the spectra, some approaching unity. We propose a novel low-rank matrix factorization method that uses autoregressive regularization and periodic spline detrending to recover the missingness. The method is a two-step procedure, each of which tackles scattered and downtime missingness, respectively. We design efficient alternating algorithms to jointly estimate the model parameters. Moreover, we build a distribution-free uncertainty quantification method using conformal prediction. We validate the prediction interval coverage rates and assess the imputation accuracy against competing models such as Gaussian process regression and linear time series smoothing via numerical experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Temporal Fusion Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04048v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), proposed by Lim et al. [\textit{International Journal of Forecasting}, 2021], is a state-of-the-art attention-based deep neural network architecture specifically designed for multi-horizon time series forecasting. It has demonstrated significant performance improvements over existing benchmarks. In this work, we propose a Quantum Temporal Fusion Transformer (QTFT), a quantum-enhanced hybrid quantum-classical architecture that extends the capabilities of the classical TFT framework. Our results demonstrate that QTFT is successfully trained on the forecasting datasets and is capable of accurately predicting future values. In particular, our experimental results display that in certain test cases, the model outperforms its classical counterpart in terms of both training and test loss, while in the remaining cases, it achieves comparable performance. A key advantage of our approach lies in its foundation on a variational quantum algorithm, enabling implementation on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices without strict requirements on the number of qubits or circuit depth.</p></details> |  |
| **[FeDaL: Federated Dataset Learning for Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04045v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dataset-wise heterogeneity introduces significant domain biases that fundamentally degrade generalization on Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs), yet this challenge remains underexplored. This paper rethink the development of TSFMs using the paradigm of federated learning. We propose a novel Federated Dataset Learning (FeDaL) approach to tackle heterogeneous time series by learning dataset-agnostic temporal representations. Specifically, the distributed architecture of federated learning is a nature solution to decompose heterogeneous TS datasets into shared generalized knowledge and preserved personalized knowledge. Moreover, based on the TSFM architecture, FeDaL explicitly mitigates both local and global biases by adding two complementary mechanisms: Domain Bias Elimination (DBE) and Global Bias Elimination (GBE). FeDaL`s cross-dataset generalization has been extensively evaluated in real-world datasets spanning eight tasks, including both representation learning and downstream time series analysis, against 54 baselines. We further analyze federated scaling behavior, showing how data volume, client count, and join rate affect model performance under decentralization.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, scaling FL to time series foundation models</p></details> |

However, existing methods are trained for fixed activity sets and require costly retraining when new behaviours or sensor setups appear. Recent attempts to use large language models (LLMs) for HAR, typically by converting signals into text or images, suffer from limited accuracy and lack verifiable interpretability. We propose ZARA, the first agent-based framework for zero-shot, explainable HAR directly from raw motion time-series. ZARA integrates an automatically derived pair-wise feature knowledge base that captures discriminative statistics for every activity pair, a multi-sensor retrieval module that surfaces relevant evidence, and a hierarchical agent pipeline that guides the LLM to iteratively select features, draw on this evidence, and produce both activity predictions and natural-language explanations. ZARA enables flexible and interpretable HAR without any fine-tuning or task-specific classifiers. Extensive experiments on 8 HAR benchmarks show that ZARA achieves SOTA zero-shot performance, delivering clear reasoning while exceeding the strongest baselines by 2.53x in macro F1. Ablation studies further confirm the necessity of each module, marking ZARA as a promising step toward trustworthy, plug-and-play motion time-series analysis. Our codes are available at https://github.com/zechenli03/ZARA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Supervised Dynamic Dimension Reduction with Deep Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03546v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the problem of dimension reduction, tailored to improving time series forecasting with high-dimensional predictors. We propose a novel Supervised Deep Dynamic Principal component analysis (SDDP) framework that incorporates the target variable and lagged observations into the factor extraction process. Assisted by a temporal neural network, we construct target-aware predictors by scaling the original predictors in a supervised manner, with larger weights assigned to predictors with stronger forecasting power. A principal component analysis is then performed on the target-aware predictors to extract the estimated SDDP factors. This supervised factor extraction not only improves predictive accuracy in the downstream forecasting task but also yields more interpretable and target-specific latent factors. Building upon SDDP, we propose a factor-augmented nonlinear dynamic forecasting model that unifies a broad family of factor-model-based forecasting approaches. To further demonstrate the broader applicability of SDDP, we extend our studies to a more challenging scenario when the predictors are only partially observable. We validate the empirical performance of the proposed method on several real-world public datasets. The results show that our algorithm achieves notable improvements in forecasting accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Exploiting the diffeomorphic nature of ODE solution maps, neural ODEs has also enabled their use in generative modeling. Despite the rich potential to incorporate various kinds of physical information, training Neural ODEs remains challenging in practice. This study demonstrates, through the simplest one-dimensional linear model, why training Neural ODEs is difficult. We then propose a new stabilization method and provide an analytical convergence analysis. The insights and techniques presented here serve as a concise tutorial for researchers beginning work on Neural ODEs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted SICE FES 2025</p></details> |
| **[ProtoECGNet: Case-Based Interpretable Deep Learning for Multi-Label ECG Classification with Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08713v4)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based electrocardiogram (ECG) classification has shown impressive performance but clinical adoption has been slowed by the lack of transparent and faithful explanations. Post hoc methods such as saliency maps may fail to reflect a model's true decision process. Prototype-based reasoning offers a more transparent alternative by grounding decisions in similarity to learned representations of real ECG segments, enabling faithful, case-based explanations. We introduce ProtoECGNet, a prototype-based deep learning model for interpretable, multi-label ECG classification. ProtoECGNet employs a structured, multi-branch architecture that reflects clinical interpretation workflows: it integrates a 1D CNN with global prototypes for rhythm classification, a 2D CNN with time-localized prototypes for morphology-based reasoning, and a 2D CNN with global prototypes for diffuse abnormalities. Each branch is trained with a prototype loss designed for multi-label learning, combining clustering, separation, diversity, and a novel contrastive loss that encourages appropriate separation between prototypes of unrelated classes while allowing clustering for frequently co-occurring diagnoses. We evaluate ProtoECGNet on all 71 diagnostic labels from the PTB-XL dataset, demonstrating competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art black-box models while providing structured, case-based explanations. To assess prototype quality, we conduct a structured clinician review of the final model's projected prototypes, finding that they are rated as representative and clear. ProtoECGNet shows that prototype learning can be effectively scaled to complex, multi-label time-series classification, offering a practical path toward transparent and trustworthy deep learning models for clinical decision support.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in PMLR 298, 10th Machine Learning for Healthcare Conference (MLHC)</p></details> |
| **[CLaSP: Learning Concepts for Time-Series Signals from Natural Language Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08397v3)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents CLaSP, a novel model for retrieving time-series signals using natural language queries that describe signal characteristics. The ability to search time-series signals based on descriptive queries is essential in domains such as industrial diagnostics, where data scientists often need to find signals with specific characteristics. However, existing methods rely on sketch-based inputs, predefined synonym dictionaries, or domain-specific manual designs, limiting their scalability and adaptability. CLaSP addresses these challenges by employing contrastive learning to map time-series signals to natural language descriptions. Unlike prior approaches, it eliminates the need for predefined synonym dictionaries and leverages the rich contextual knowledge of large language models (LLMs). Using the TRUCE and SUSHI datasets, which pair time-series signals with natural language descriptions, we demonstrate that CLaSP achieves high accuracy in retrieving a variety of time series patterns based on natural language queries.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic User-controllable Privacy-preserving Few-shot Sensing Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03989v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>User-controllable privacy is important in modern sensing systems, as privacy preferences can vary significantly from person to person and may evolve over time. This is especially relevant in devices equipped with Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors, such as smartphones and wearables, which continuously collect rich time-series data that can inadvertently expose sensitive user behaviors. While prior work has proposed privacy-preserving methods for sensor data, most rely on static, predefined privacy labels or require large quantities of private training data, limiting their adaptability and user agency. In this work, we introduce PrivCLIP, a dynamic, user-controllable, few-shot privacy-preserving sensing framework. PrivCLIP allows users to specify and modify their privacy preferences by categorizing activities as sensitive (black-listed), non-sensitive (white-listed), or neutral (gray-listed). Leveraging a multimodal contrastive learning approach, PrivCLIP aligns IMU sensor data with natural language activity descriptions in a shared embedding space, enabling few-shot detection of sensitive activities. When a privacy-sensitive activity is identified, the system uses a language-guided activity sanitizer and a motion generation module (IMU-GPT) to transform the original data into a privacy-compliant version that semantically resembles a non-sensitive activity. We evaluate PrivCLIP on multiple human activity recognition datasets and demonstrate that it significantly outperforms baseline methods in terms of both privacy protection and data utility.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPADE-S: A Sparsity-Robust Foundational Forecaster](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21155v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant advancements in time series forecasting, accurate modeling of time series with strong heterogeneity in magnitude and/or sparsity patterns remains challenging for state-of-the-art deep learning architectures. We identify several factors that lead existing models to systematically underperform on low-magnitude and sparse time series, including loss functions with implicit biases toward high-magnitude series, training-time sampling methods, and limitations of time series encoding methods. SPADE-S is a robust forecasting architecture that significantly reduces magnitude- and sparsity-based systematic biases and improves overall prediction accuracy. Empirical results demonstrate that SPADE-S outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches across a diverse set of use cases in demand forecasting. In particular, we show that, depending on the quantile forecast and magnitude of the series, SPADE-S can improve forecast accuracy by up to 15%. This results in P90 overall forecast accuracy gains of 2.21%, 6.58%, and 4.28%, and P50 forecast accuracy gains of 0.92%, 0.77%, and 1.95%, respectively, for each of three distinct datasets, ranging from 3 million to 700 million series, from a large online retailer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Large Language Models Adequately Perform Symbolic Reasoning Over Time Series?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03963v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uncovering hidden symbolic laws from time series data, as an aspiration dating back to Kepler's discovery of planetary motion, remains a core challenge in scientific discovery and artificial intelligence. While Large Language Models show promise in structured reasoning tasks, their ability to infer interpretable, context-aligned symbolic structures from time series data is still underexplored. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce SymbolBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess symbolic reasoning over real-world time series across three tasks: multivariate symbolic regression, Boolean network inference, and causal discovery. Unlike prior efforts limited to simple algebraic equations, SymbolBench spans a diverse set of symbolic forms with varying complexity. We further propose a unified framework that integrates LLMs with genetic programming to form a closed-loop symbolic reasoning system, where LLMs act both as predictors and evaluators. Our empirical results reveal key strengths and limitations of current models, highlighting the importance of combining domain knowledge, context alignment, and reasoning structure to improve LLMs in automated scientific discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Active Learning and Transfer Learning for Anomaly Detection in Time-Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03921v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper examines the effectiveness of combining active learning and transfer learning for anomaly detection in cross-domain time-series data. Our results indicate that there is an interaction between clustering and active learning and in general the best performance is achieved using a single cluster (in other words when clustering is not applied). Also, we find that adding new samples to the training set using active learning does improve model performance but that in general, the rate of improvement is slower than the results reported in the literature suggest. We attribute this difference to an improved experimental design where distinct data samples are used for the sampling and testing pools. Finally, we assess the ceiling performance of transfer learning in combination with active learning across several datasets and find that performance does initially improve but eventually begins to tail off as more target points are selected for inclusion in training. This tail-off in performance may indicate that the active learning process is doing a good job of sequencing data points for selection, pushing the less useful points towards the end of the selection process and that this tail-off occurs when these less useful points are eventually added. Taken together our results indicate that active learning is effective but that the improvement in model performance follows a linear flat function concerning the number of points selected and labelled.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discovering group dynamics in coordinated time series via hierarchical recurrent switching-state models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14973v3)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We seek a computationally efficient model for a collection of time series arising from multiple interacting entities (a.k.a. "agents"). Recent models of temporal patterns across individuals fail to incorporate explicit system-level collective behavior that can influence the trajectories of individual entities. To address this gap in the literature, we present a new hierarchical switching-state model that can be trained in an unsupervised fashion to simultaneously learn both system-level and individual-level dynamics. We employ a latent system-level discrete state Markov chain that provides top-down influence on latent entity-level chains which in turn govern the emission of each observed time series. Recurrent feedback from the observations to the latent chains at both entity and system levels allows recent situational context to inform how dynamics unfold at all levels in bottom-up fashion. We hypothesize that including both top-down and bottom-up influences on group dynamics will improve interpretability of the learned dynamics and reduce error when forecasting. Our hierarchical switching recurrent dynamical model can be learned via closed-form variational coordinate ascent updates to all latent chains that scale linearly in the number of entities. This is asymptotically no more costly than fitting a separate model for each entity. Analysis of both synthetic data and real basketball team movements suggests our lean parametric model can achieve competitive forecasts compared to larger neural network models that require far more computational resources. Further experiments on soldier data as well as a synthetic task with 64 cooperating entities show how our approach can yield interpretable insights about team dynamics over time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Imputation Drives Cross-Domain Alignment for EEG Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03437v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal classification faces significant challenges due to data distribution shifts caused by heterogeneous electrode configurations, acquisition protocols, and hardware discrepancies across domains. This paper introduces IMAC, a novel channel-dependent mask and imputation self-supervised framework that formulates the alignment of cross-domain EEG data shifts as a spatial time series imputation task. To address heterogeneous electrode configurations in cross-domain scenarios, IMAC first standardizes different electrode layouts using a 3D-to-2D positional unification mapping strategy, establishing unified spatial representations. Unlike previous mask-based self-supervised representation learning methods, IMAC introduces spatio-temporal signal alignment. This involves constructing a channel-dependent mask and reconstruction task framed as a low-to-high resolution EEG spatial imputation problem. Consequently, this approach simulates cross-domain variations such as channel omissions and temporal instabilities, thus enabling the model to leverage the proposed imputer for robust signal alignment during inference. Furthermore, IMAC incorporates a disentangled structure that separately models the temporal and spatial information of the EEG signals separately, reducing computational complexity while enhancing flexibility and adaptability. Comprehensive evaluations across 10 publicly available EEG datasets demonstrate IMAC's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art classification accuracy in both cross-subject and cross-center validation scenarios. Notably, IMAC shows strong robustness under both simulated and real-world distribution shifts, surpassing baseline methods by up to $35$\% in integrity scores while maintaining consistent classification accuracy.</p></details> | ACMMM 2025 poster |

Powered by UniTS, a state-of-the-art (SoTA) universal time-series model, our framework autonomously learns each patient's unique physiological and behavioral patterns, detecting subtle deviations that signal potential health risks. Unlike classification methods that require impractical, continuous labeling in real-world scenarios, our approach uses anomaly detection to provide real-time, personalized alerts for reactive home-care interventions. Our approach outperforms 12 SoTA anomaly detection methods, demonstrating robustness across both high-fidelity medical devices (ECG) and consumer wearables, with a ~ 22% improvement in F1 score. However, the true impact of AI on the Pulse lies in @HOME, where it has been successfully deployed for continuous, real-world patient monitoring. By operating with non-invasive, lightweight devices like smartwatches, our system proves that high-quality health monitoring is possible without clinical-grade equipment. Beyond detection, we enhance interpretability by integrating LLMs, translating anomaly scores into clinically meaningful insights for healthcare professionals.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonparametric data segmentation in multivariate time series via joint characteristic functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07581v5)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern time series data often exhibit complex dependence and structural changes which are not easily characterised by shifts in the mean or model parameters. We propose a nonparametric data segmentation methodology for multivariate time series termed NP-MOJO. By considering joint characteristic functions between the time series and its lagged values, NP-MOJO is able to detect change points in the marginal distribution, but also those in possibly non-linear serial dependence, all without the need to pre-specify the type of changes. We show the theoretical consistency of NP-MOJO in estimating the total number and the locations of the change points, and demonstrate the good performance of NP-MOJO against a variety of change point scenarios. We further demonstrate its usefulness in applications to seismology and economic time series.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging ocean wave physics and deep learning: Physics-informed neural operators for nonlinear wavefield reconstruction in real-time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03315v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate real-time prediction of phase-resolved ocean wave fields remains a critical yet largely unsolved problem, primarily due to the absence of practical data assimilation methods for reconstructing initial conditions from sparse or indirect wave measurements. While recent advances in supervised deep learning have shown potential for this purpose, they require large labelled datasets of ground truth wave data, which are infeasible to obtain in real-world scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) framework for reconstructing spatially and temporally phase-resolved, nonlinear ocean wave fields from sparse measurements, without the need for ground truth data during training. This is achieved by embedding residuals of the free surface boundary conditions of ocean gravity waves into the loss function of the PINO, constraining the solution space in a soft manner. After training, we validate our approach using highly realistic synthetic wave data and demonstrate the accurate reconstruction of nonlinear wave fields from both buoy time series and radar snapshots. Our results indicate that PINOs enable accurate, real-time reconstruction and generalize robustly across a wide range of wave conditions, thereby paving the way for operational, data-driven wave reconstruction and prediction in realistic marine environments.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Towards Interpretable Concept Learning over Time Series via Temporal Logic Semantics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03269v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series classification is a task of paramount importance, as this kind of data often arises in safety-critical applications. However, it is typically tackled with black-box deep learning methods, making it hard for humans to understand the rationale behind their output. To take on this challenge, we propose a neuro-symbolic framework that unifies classification and explanation through direct embedding of trajectories into a space of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) concepts. By introducing a novel STL-inspired kernel that maps raw time series to their alignment with predefined STL formulae, our model jointly optimises for accuracy and interpretability, as each prediction is accompanied by the most relevant logical concepts that characterise it. This enables classification grounded in human-interpretable temporal patterns and produces both local and global symbolic explanations. Early results show competitive performance while offering high-quality logical justifications for model decisions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Full-History Graphs with Edge-Type Decoupled Networks for Temporal Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03251v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling evolving interactions among entities is critical in many real-world tasks. For example, predicting driver maneuvers in traffic requires tracking how neighboring vehicles accelerate, brake, and change lanes relative to one another over consecutive frames. Likewise, detecting financial fraud hinges on following the flow of funds through successive transactions as they propagate through the network. Unlike classic time-series forecasting, these settings demand reasoning over who interacts with whom and when, calling for a temporal-graph representation that makes both the relations and their evolution explicit. Existing temporal-graph methods typically use snapshot graphs to encode temporal evolution. We introduce a full-history graph that instantiates one node for every entity at every time step and separates two edge sets: (i) intra-time-step edges that capture relations within a single frame and (ii) inter-time-step edges that connect an entity to itself at consecutive steps. To learn on this graph we design an Edge-Type Decoupled Network (ETDNet) with parallel modules: a graph-attention module aggregates information along intra-time-step edges, a multi-head temporal-attention module attends over an entity's inter-time-step history, and a fusion module combines the two messages after every layer. Evaluated on driver-intention prediction (Waymo) and Bitcoin fraud detection (Elliptic++), ETDNet consistently surpasses strong baselines, lifting Waymo joint accuracy to 75.6\% (vs. 74.1\%) and raising Elliptic++ illicit-class F1 to 88.1\% (vs. 60.4\%). These gains demonstrate the benefit of representing structural and temporal relations as distinct edges in a single graph.</p></details> | <details><summary>Europ...</summary><p>European Conference of Artificial Intelligence 2025</p></details> |

This inflexible approach can generate excessive tokens for even simple patterns like extended constant values, resulting in substantial computational overhead. Inspired by the success of byte pair encoding, we propose the first pattern-centric tokenization scheme for time series analysis. Based on a discrete vocabulary of frequent motifs, our method merges samples with underlying patterns into tokens, compressing time series adaptively. Exploiting our finite set of motifs and the continuous properties of time series, we further introduce conditional decoding as a lightweight yet powerful post-hoc optimization method, which requires no gradient computation and adds no computational overhead. On recent time series foundation models, our motif-based tokenization improves forecasting performance by 36% and boosts efficiency by 1990% on average. Conditional decoding further reduces MSE by up to 44%. In an extensive analysis, we demonstrate the adaptiveness of our tokenization to diverse temporal patterns, its generalization to unseen data, and its meaningful token representations capturing distinct time series properties, including statistical moments and trends.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages in total, 17 figures</p></details> |

Token merging has emerged as a solution to increase computational efficiency in computer vision architectures. In this work, we perform the first investigations of token merging in time series analysis on both transformers and state-space models. We further introduce local merging, a domain-specific token merging algorithm that selectively combines tokens within a local neighborhood, achieving two major benefits: a) Local merging can adjust its computational complexity from quadratic to linear based on the neighborhood size to effectively scale to long sequences; b) Local merging is the first causal merging scheme enabling token merging in transformer decoders. Further, we identify spectral properties of the input data that reliably predict the potential benefits of local merging without requiring evaluation on downstream tasks. Our comprehensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that local merging offers substantial efficiency gains with minimal impact on accuracy, achieving up to 5400% acceleration on the recently proposed Chronos foundation model.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages in total, 20 figures</p></details> |

The core innovation of our approach lies in its ability to transform raw time-domain signals into sparse, physically meaningful spectral representations without the use of backpropagation, high-dimensional embeddings, or data-intensive black-box models. Through rational spectral approximation, the system extracts resonant structures that are then mapped into symbolic predicates via a kernel projection function, enabling logical inference through a rule-based reasoning engine. This architecture bridges mathematical physics, sparse approximation theory, and symbolic artificial intelligence, offering a transparent and physically grounded alternative to deep learning models. We develop the full mathematical formalism underlying each stage of the pipeline, provide a modular algorithmic implementation, and demonstrate the system's effectiveness through comparative evaluations on time-series anomaly detection, symbolic classification, and hybrid reasoning tasks. Our results show that this spectral-symbolic architecture achieves competitive accuracy while maintaining interpretability and data efficiency, suggesting a promising new direction for physically-informed, reasoning-capable machine learning.</p></details> |  |

While existing methods have shown promise in unconditional single-domain TSG, real-world applications demand for cross-domain approaches capable of controlled generation tailored to domain-specific constraints and instance-level requirements. In this paper, we argue that text can provide semantic insights, domain information and instance-specific temporal patterns, to guide and improve TSG. We introduce ``Text-Controlled TSG'', a task focused on generating realistic time series by incorporating textual descriptions. To address data scarcity in this setting, we propose a novel LLM-based Multi-Agent framework that synthesizes diverse, realistic text-to-TS datasets. Furthermore, we introduce BRIDGE, a hybrid text-controlled TSG framework that integrates semantic prototypes with text description for supporting domain-level guidance. This approach achieves state-of-the-art generation fidelity on 11 of 12 datasets, and improves controllability by up to 12% on MSE and 6% MAE compared to no text input generation, highlighting its potential for generating tailored time-series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

Salient events like monetary policy decisions and employment reports often trigger market movements by shaping expectations of economic growth and risk, thereby establishing causal relationships between events and market behavior. Existing forecasting methods typically focus either on textual analysis or time-series modeling, but fail to capture the multi-modal nature of financial markets and the causal relationship between events and price movements. To address these gaps, we propose CAMEF (Causal-Augmented Multi-Modality Event-Driven Financial Forecasting), a multi-modality framework that effectively integrates textual and time-series data with a causal learning mechanism and an LLM-based counterfactual event augmentation technique for causal-enhanced financial forecasting. Our contributions include: (1) a multi-modal framework that captures causal relationships between policy texts and historical price data; (2) a new financial dataset with six types of macroeconomic releases from 2008 to April 2024, and high-frequency real trading data for five key U.S. financial assets; and (3) an LLM-based counterfactual event augmentation strategy. We compare CAMEF to state-of-the-art transformer-based time-series and multi-modal baselines, and perform ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of the causal learning mechanism and event types.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in SIGKDD 2025</p></details> |

In this study, we propose a method to systematically generate domain-independent descriptive texts from time-series data. We identify two distinct approaches for creating pairs of time-series data and descriptive texts: the forward approach and the backward approach. By implementing the novel backward approach, we create the Temporal Automated Captions for Observations (TACO) dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that a contrastive learning based model trained using the TACO dataset is capable of generating descriptive texts for time-series data in novel domains.</p></details> |  |

Complementary data structured streams become available sooner but suffer from incompleteness. To train models and algorithms on more complete and temporally fine-grained data, we construct a pipeline to phenotype, extract, and annotate time-localized findings within case reports using large language models. We apply our pipeline to generate an open-access textual time series corpus for Sepsis-3 comprising 2,139 case reports from the Pubmed-Open Access (PMOA) Subset. To validate our system, we apply it on PMOA and timeline annotations from I2B2/MIMIC-IV and compare the results to physician-expert annotations. We show high recovery rates of clinical findings (event match rates: O1-preview--0.755, Llama 3.3 70B Instruct--0.753) and strong temporal ordering (concordance: O1-preview--0.932, Llama 3.3 70B Instruct--0.932).

While Transformer-based models have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance in long-range forecasting, they often suffer from interpretability issues and instability in the presence of noise or dynamical uncertainty. In this work, we propose DeepKoopFormer, a principled forecasting framework that combines the representational power of Transformers with the theoretical rigor of Koopman operator theory. Our model features a modular encoder-propagator-decoder structure, where temporal dynamics are learned via a spectrally constrained, linear Koopman operator in a latent space. We impose structural guarantees-such as bounded spectral radius, Lyapunov based energy regularization, and orthogonal parameterization to ensure stability and interpretability. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on both synthetic dynamical systems, real-world climate dataset (wind speed and surface pressure), financial time series (cryptocurrency), and electricity generation dataset using the Python package that is prepared for this purpose. Across all experiments, DeepKoopFormer consistently outperforms standard LSTM and baseline Transformer models in terms of accuracy, robustness to noise, and long-term forecasting stability. These results establish DeepKoopFormer as a flexible, interpretable, and robust framework for forecasting in high dimensional and dynamical settings.</p></details> |  |

Robots must analyze interactions with objects to ensure safety and facilitate meaningful workflows. One critical aspect is human/object detection, where the contacted object is identified. Past research introduced binary machine learning classifiers to distinguish between soft and hard objects. This study improves upon those results by evaluating three-class human/object detection models, offering more detailed contact analysis. A dataset was collected using the Franka Emika Panda robot manipulator, exploring preprocessing strategies for time-series analysis. Models including LSTM, GRU, and Transformers were trained on these datasets. The best-performing model achieved 91.11\% accuracy during real-time testing, demonstrating the feasibility of multi-class detection models. Additionally, a comparison of preprocessing strategies suggests a sliding window approach is optimal for this task.</p></details> |  |

The standard method for training machine learning models while ensuring privacy for units of sensitive information, such as individual hospital visits, is differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD). However, we observe in this work that the formal guarantees of DP-SGD are incompatible with time series specific tasks like forecasting, since they rely on the privacy amplification attained by training on small, unstructured batches sampled from an unstructured dataset. In contrast, batches for forecasting are generated by (1) sampling sequentially structured time series from a dataset, (2) sampling contiguous subsequences from these series, and (3) partitioning them into context and ground-truth forecast windows. We theoretically analyze the privacy amplification attained by this structured subsampling to enable the training of forecasting models with sound and tight event- and user-level privacy guarantees. Towards more private models, we additionally prove how data augmentation amplifies privacy in self-supervised training of sequence models. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that amplification by structured subsampling enables the training of forecasting models with strong formal privacy guarantees.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as ICML 2025 Spotlight</p></details> |

However, analyzing complex time series data remains a challenging and unresolved problem due to its high dimensionality, dynamic nature, and complex interactions among variables. Inspired by the strong structural modeling capability of hypergraphs, this paper proposes a novel hypergraph-based time series transformer backbone network, termed HGTS-Former, to address the multivariate coupling in time series data. Specifically, given the multivariate time series signal, we first normalize and embed each patch into tokens. Then, we adopt the multi-head self-attention to enhance the temporal representation of each patch. The hierarchical hypergraphs are constructed to aggregate the temporal patterns within each channel and fine-grained relations between different variables. After that, we convert the hyperedge into node features through the EdgeToNode module and adopt the feed-forward network to further enhance the output features. Extensive experiments conducted on two multivariate time series tasks and eight datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed HGTS-Former.

Specifically, we formulate a manifold-regularised variant of the $\ell_p$-SVDD method to encourage label smoothness on the underlying manifold to capture structural information for improved detection performance. Drawing on an existing Representer theorem, we then provide an effective optimisation technique for the proposed method. We theoretically study the proposed approach using Rademacher complexities to analyse its generalisation performance and also provide an experimental assessment of the proposed method across various data sets to compare its performance against other methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Factor-Driven Network Informed Restricted Vector Autoregression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02198v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional financial time series often exhibit complex dependence relations driven by both common market structures and latent connections among assets. To capture these characteristics, this paper proposes Factor-Driven Network Informed Restricted Vector Autoregression (FNIRVAR), a model for the common and idiosyncratic components of high-dimensional time series with an underlying unobserved network structure. The common component is modelled by a static factor model, which allows for strong cross-sectional dependence, whilst a network vector autoregressive process captures the residual co-movements due to the idiosyncratic component. An assortative stochastic block model underlies the network VAR, leading to groups of highly co-moving variables in the idiosyncratic component. For estimation, a two-step procedure is proposed, whereby the static factors are estimated via principal component analysis, followed by estimation of the network VAR parameters. The method is demonstrated in financial applications to daily returns, intraday returns, and FRED-MD macroeconomic variables. In all cases, the proposed method outperforms a static factor model, as well as a static factor plus LASSO-estimated sparse VAR model, in terms of forecasting and financial performance metrics.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |

However, their potential for spatial modeling in multivariate time-series forecasting remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce a brand new SNN architecture, which is among the first to seamlessly integrate graph structural learning with spike-based temporal processing for multivariate time-series forecasting. Specifically, we first embed time features and an adaptive matrix, eliminating the need for predefined graph structures. We then further learn sequence features through the Observation (OBS) Block. Building upon this, our Multi-Scale Spike Aggregation (MSSA) hierarchically aggregates neighborhood information through spiking SAGE layers, enabling multi-hop feature extraction while eliminating the need for floating-point operations. Finally, we propose a Dual-Path Spike Fusion (DSF) Block to integrate spatial graph features and temporal dynamics via a spike-gated mechanism, combining LSTM-processed sequences with spiking self-attention outputs, effectively improve the model accuracy of long sequence datasets. Experiments show that our model surpasses the state-of-the-art SNN-based iSpikformer on all datasets and outperforms traditional temporal models at long horizons, thereby establishing a new paradigm for efficient spatial-temporal modeling.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |
| **[IFD: A Large-Scale Benchmark for Insider Filing Violation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20162v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Insider trading violations, particularly delayed disclosures of Form 4 filings, remain a persistent challenge for financial market surveillance. Despite regulatory requirements such as the two-business-day rule of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), enforcement is limited by the lack of large-scale, labeled datasets and task-specific benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce the Insider Filing Delay (IFD) dataset, the first and largest publicly available resource for insider disclosure behavior, comprising over one million Form 4 transactions spanning two decades (2002 to 2025), with structured annotations on delay status, insider roles, governance factors, and firm-level financial indicators. IFD enables the first large-scale formulation of strategic disclosure violation detection as a binary classification task grounded in regulatory compliance. To demonstrate the utility of IFD, we propose MaBoost, a hybrid framework combining a Mamba-based state space encoder with XGBoost, achieving high accuracy and interpretability in identifying high-risk behavioral patterns. Experiments across statistical baselines, deep learning models, and large language models confirm that MaBoost outperforms prior approaches, achieving an F1 score of up to 99.47 percent under constrained regulatory settings. IFD provides a realistic, reproducible, and behavior-rich dataset for developing AI models in financial compliance, regulatory forensics, and interpretable time series classification.

While prior studies have largely employed reconstruction-based approaches, which limit the models' representational capacities. Moreover, existing deep learning-based methods are not sufficiently lightweight. Addressing these issues, we present PatchAD, our novel, highly efficient multiscale patch-based MLP-Mixer architecture that utilizes contrastive learning for representation extraction and anomaly detection. With its four distinct MLP Mixers and innovative dual project constraint module, PatchAD mitigates potential model degradation and offers a lightweight solution, requiring only $0.403M$ parameters. Its efficacy is demonstrated by state-of-the-art results across $8$ datasets sourced from different application scenarios, outperforming over $30$ comparative algorithms. PatchAD significantly improves the classical F1 score by 6.84%, the Aff-F1 score by 4.27%, and the V-ROC by 2.49%. Simultaneously, an in-depth analysis of the mechanisms underlying PatchAD has been conducted from both theoretical and experimental perspectives, validating the design motivations of the model.

| **[Revitalizing Canonical Pre-Alignment for Irregular Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01971v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregular multivariate time series (IMTS), characterized by uneven sampling and inter-variate asynchrony, fuel many forecasting applications yet remain challenging to model efficiently. Canonical Pre-Alignment (CPA) has been widely adopted in IMTS modeling by padding zeros at every global timestamp, thereby alleviating inter-variate asynchrony and unifying the series length, but its dense zero-padding inflates the pre-aligned series length, especially when numerous variates are present, causing prohibitive compute overhead. Recent graph-based models with patching strategies sidestep CPA, but their local message passing struggles to capture global inter-variate correlations. Therefore, we posit that CPA should be retained, with the pre-aligned series properly handled by the model, enabling it to outperform state-of-the-art graph-based baselines that sidestep CPA. Technically, we propose KAFNet, a compact architecture grounded in CPA for IMTS forecasting that couples (1) Pre-Convolution module for sequence smoothing and sparsity mitigation, (2) Temporal Kernel Aggregation module for learnable compression and modeling of intra-series irregularity, and (3) Frequency Linear Attention blocks for the low-cost inter-series correlations modeling in the frequency domain. Experiments on multiple IMTS datasets show that KAFNet achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance, with a 7.2$\times$ parameter reduction and a 8.4$\times$ training-inference acceleration.</p></details> | Under review |

While functional connectivity captures statistical associations, it does not reveal directionality or causal mechanisms. We introduce CITS (Causal Inference in Time Series), a non-parametric method for inferring statistically causal neural circuitry from high-resolution time series data. CITS models neural dynamics using a structural causal model with arbitrary Markov order and tests for time-lagged conditional independence using either Gaussian or distribution-free statistics. Unlike classical Granger Causality, which assumes linear autoregressive models and Gaussian noise, or the Peter-Clark algorithm, which assumes i.i.d. data and no temporal structure, CITS handles temporally dependent, potentially non-Gaussian data with flexible testing procedures. We prove consistency under mild mixing assumptions and validate CITS on simulated linear, nonlinear, and continuous-time recurrent neural network data, where it outperforms state-of-the-art methods. We then apply CITS to Neuropixels recordings from mouse brain during visual tasks. CITS uncovers interpretable, stimulus-specific causal circuits linking cortical, thalamic, and hippocampal regions, consistent with experimental literature. It also reveals that neurons with similar orientation selectivity indices are more likely to be causally connected. Our results demonstrate the utility of CITS in uncovering biologically meaningful pathways and generating hypotheses for future experimental studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2312.09604</p></details> |
| **[Constructing prediction intervals for the age distribution of deaths](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17953v2)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a model-agnostic procedure to construct prediction intervals for the age distribution of deaths. The age distribution of deaths is an example of constrained data, which are nonnegative and have a constrained integral. A centered log-ratio transformation and a cumulative distribution function transformation are used to remove the two constraints, where the latter transformation can also handle the presence of zero counts. Our general procedure divides data samples into training, validation, and testing sets. Within the validation set, we can select an optimal tuning parameter by calibrating the empirical coverage probabilities to be close to their nominal ones. With the selected optimal tuning parameter, we then construct the pointwise prediction intervals using the same models for the holdout data in the testing set. Using Japanese age- and sex-specific life-table death counts, we assess and evaluate the interval forecast accuracy with a suite of functional time-series models.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 4 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

However, in cryptocurrency markets, characterized by 24/7 trading, extreme volatility, and rapid regime shifts, existing Time Series Generation (TSG) methods and benchmarks often fall short, jeopardizing practical utility. Most prior work (1) targets non-financial or traditional financial domains, (2) focuses narrowly on classification and forecasting while neglecting crypto-specific complexities, and (3) lacks critical financial evaluations, particularly for trading applications. To address these gaps, we introduce \textsf{CTBench}, the first comprehensive TSG benchmark tailored for the cryptocurrency domain. \textsf{CTBench} curates an open-source dataset from 452 tokens and evaluates TSG models across 13 metrics spanning 5 key dimensions: forecasting accuracy, rank fidelity, trading performance, risk assessment, and computational efficiency. A key innovation is a dual-task evaluation framework: (1) the \emph{Predictive Utility} task measures how well synthetic data preserves temporal and cross-sectional patterns for forecasting, while (2) the \emph{Statistical Arbitrage} task assesses whether reconstructed series support mean-reverting signals for trading. We benchmark eight representative models from five methodological families over four distinct market regimes, uncovering trade-offs between statistical fidelity and real-world profitability. Notably, \textsf{CTBench} offers model ranking analysis and actionable guidance for selecting and deploying TSG models in crypto analytics and strategy development.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 14 figures, and 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Causal Discovery in Multivariate Time Series through Mutual Information Featurization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01848v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discovering causal relationships in complex multivariate time series is a fundamental scientific challenge. Traditional methods often falter, either by relying on restrictive linear assumptions or on conditional independence tests that become uninformative in the presence of intricate, non-linear dynamics. This paper proposes a new paradigm, shifting from statistical testing to pattern recognition. We hypothesize that a causal link creates a persistent and learnable asymmetry in the flow of information through a system's temporal graph, even when clear conditional independencies are obscured. We introduce Temporal Dependency to Causality (TD2C), a supervised learning framework that operationalizes this hypothesis. TD2C learns to recognize these complex causal signatures from a rich set of information-theoretic and statistical descriptors. Trained exclusively on a diverse collection of synthetic time series, TD2C demonstrates remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen dynamics and established, realistic benchmarks. Our results show that TD2C achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming established methods, particularly in high-dimensional and non-linear settings. By reframing the discovery problem, our work provides a robust and scalable new tool for uncovering causal structures in complex systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Predictive Control to Coordinate Discrete- and Continuous-Time Models for Time-Series Analysis with Control-Theoretical Improvements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01833v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep sequence models have achieved notable success in time-series analysis, such as interpolation and forecasting. Recent advances move beyond discrete-time architectures like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) toward continuous-time formulations such as the family of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs). Generally, they have shown that capturing the underlying dynamics is beneficial for generic tasks like interpolation, extrapolation, and classification. However, existing methods approximate the dynamics using unconstrained neural networks, which struggle to adapt reliably under distributional shifts. In this paper, we recast time-series problems as the continuous ODE-based optimal control problem. Rather than learning dynamics solely from data, we optimize control actions that steer ODE trajectories toward task objectives, bringing control-theoretical performance guarantees. To achieve this goal, we need to (1) design the appropriate control actions and (2) apply effective optimal control algorithms. As the actions should contain rich context information, we propose to employ the discrete-time model to process past sequences and generate actions, leading to a coordinate model to extract long-term temporal features to modulate short-term continuous dynamics. During training, we apply model predictive control to plan multi-step future trajectories, minimize a task-specific cost, and greedily select the optimal current action. We show that, under mild assumptions, this multi-horizon optimization leads to exponential convergence to infinite-horizon solutions, indicating that the coordinate model can gain robust and generalizable performance. Extensive experiments on diverse time-series datasets validate our method's superior generalization and adaptability compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, submitted to ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining</p></details> |

In this paper, a novel cross-domain knowledge transfer framework is proposed to enhance the performance of LLMs in time series forecasting -- a task of increasing relevance in fields such as energy systems, finance, and healthcare. The approach systematically infuses LLMs with structured temporal information to improve their forecasting accuracy. This study evaluates the proposed method on a real-world time series dataset and compares it to a naive baseline where the LLM receives no auxiliary information. Results show that knowledge-informed forecasting significantly outperforms the uninformed baseline in terms of predictive accuracy and generalization. These findings highlight the potential of knowledge transfer strategies to bridge the gap between LLMs and domain-specific forecasting tasks.</p></details> |  |

To address this question, one of us has collected a time series of data for social interactions between chimpanzees. Here we use a network representation, leading to the task of combining these data into a time series of a single weighted network per time stamp, where different proximities should be given different weights reflecting their relative importance. We optimize these proximity-type weights in a principled way, using an innovative loss function which rewards structural consistency for consecutive time steps. The approach is empirically validated by carefully designed synthetic data. Using statistical tests, we provide a way of identifying groups of individuals that stay related for a significant length of time. Applying the approach to the chimpanzee data set, we detect cliques in the animal social network time series, which can be validated by real-world intuition from prior research and qualitative observations by chimpanzee experts.</p></details> |  |

We further investigate the asymptotic spectral properties of the sample correlation matrix of high-dimensional autoregressive processes. To apply our theoretical results, we propose a novel high-dimensional unit root test and develop a forward sequential test to determine the number of unit roots in high-dimensional time series data. Finally, we conduct an empirical study of the purchasing power parity (PPP) hypothesis in high-dimensional settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantically-Guided Inference for Conditional Diffusion Models: Enhancing Covariate Consistency in Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01761v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated strong performance in time series forecasting, yet often suffer from semantic misalignment between generated trajectories and conditioning covariates, especially under complex or multimodal conditions. To address this issue, we propose SemGuide, a plug-and-play, inference-time method that enhances covariate consistency in conditional diffusion models. Our approach introduces a scoring network to assess the semantic alignment between intermediate diffusion states and future covariates. These scores serve as proxy likelihoods in a stepwise importance reweighting procedure, which progressively adjusts the sampling path without altering the original training process. The method is model-agnostic and compatible with any conditional diffusion framework. Experiments on real-world forecasting tasks show consistent gains in both predictive accuracy and covariate alignment, with especially strong performance under complex conditioning scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, current approaches share a fundamental limitation: they aggregate token-level measurements into scalar scores, discarding positional information about where anomalies occur. Our empirical analysis reveals that AI-generated text exhibits significant non-stationarity, statistical properties vary by 73.8\% more between text segments compared to human writing. This discovery explains why existing detectors fail against localized adversarial perturbations that exploit this overlooked characteristic. We introduce Temporal Discrepancy Tomography (TDT), a novel detection paradigm that preserves positional information by reformulating detection as a signal processing task. TDT treats token-level discrepancies as a time-series signal and applies Continuous Wavelet Transform to generate a two-dimensional time-scale representation, capturing both the location and linguistic scale of statistical anomalies. On the RAID benchmark, TDT achieves 0.855 AUROC (7.1\% improvement over the best baseline). More importantly, TDT demonstrates robust performance on adversarial tasks, with 14.1\% AUROC improvement on HART Level 2 paraphrasing attacks. Despite its sophisticated analysis, TDT maintains practical efficiency with only 13\% computational overhead. Our work establishes non-stationarity as a fundamental characteristic of AI-generated text and demonstrates that preserving temporal dynamics is essential for robust detection.</p></details> |  |

Built from heterologous data of NASDAQ 100 companies, FinTMMBench offers three significant advantages. 1) Multi-modal Corpus: It encompasses a hybrid of financial tables, news articles, daily stock prices, and visual technical charts as the corpus. 2) Temporal-aware Questions: Each question requires the retrieval and interpretation of its relevant data over a specific time period, including daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual periods. 3) Diverse Financial Analysis Tasks: The questions involve 10 different financial analysis tasks designed by domain experts, including information extraction, trend analysis, sentiment analysis and event detection, etc. We further propose a novel TMMHybridRAG method, which first leverages LLMs to convert data from other modalities (e.g., tabular, visual and time-series data) into textual format and then incorporates temporal information in each node when constructing graphs and dense indexes. Its effectiveness has been validated in extensive experiments, but notable gaps remain, highlighting the challenges presented by our FinTMMBench.</p></details> | Accepted by MM 2025 |

While most existing brain foundation models are pre-trained on time-series signals or connectome features, we propose a novel graph-based pre-training paradigm for constructing a brain graph foundation model. In this paper, we introduce the Brain Graph Foundation Model, termed BrainGFM, a unified framework that leverages graph contrastive learning and graph masked autoencoders for large-scale fMRI-based pre-training. BrainGFM is pre-trained on a diverse mixture of brain atlases with varying parcellations, significantly expanding the pre-training corpus and enhancing the model's ability to generalize across heterogeneous fMRI-derived brain representations. To support efficient and versatile downstream transfer, we integrate both graph prompts and language prompts into the model design, enabling BrainGFM to flexibly adapt to a wide range of atlases, neurological and psychiatric disorders, and task settings. Furthermore, we employ meta-learning to optimize the graph prompts, facilitating strong generalization to previously unseen disorders under both few-shot and zero-shot learning conditions via language-guided prompting. BrainGFM is pre-trained on 27 neuroimaging datasets spanning 25 common neurological and psychiatric disorders, encompassing 2 types of brain atlases (functional and anatomical) across 8 widely-used parcellations, and covering over 25,000 subjects, 60,000 fMRI scans, and a total of 400,000 graph samples aggregated across all atlases and parcellations.

We reveal that while vision models enhance forecasting performance, 99% of their parameters are unnecessary for time series tasks. Through cross-modal analysis, we find that time series align with low-level textural features but not high-level semantics, which can impair forecasting accuracy. We propose OccamVTS, a knowledge distillation framework that extracts only the essential 1% of predictive information from LVMs into lightweight networks. Using pre-trained LVMs as privileged teachers, OccamVTS employs pyramid-style feature alignment combined with correlation and feature distillation to transfer beneficial patterns while filtering out semantic noise. Counterintuitively, this aggressive parameter reduction improves accuracy by eliminating overfitting to irrelevant visual features while preserving essential temporal patterns. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that OccamVTS consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 1% of the original parameters, particularly excelling in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Traditional HAR systems often rely on single modalities, such as motion sensors or cameras, limiting robustness and accuracy in real-world environments. This work presents FedTime-MAGNET, a novel multimodal federated learning framework that advances HAR by combining heterogeneous data sources: depth cameras, pressure mats, and accelerometers. At its core is the Multimodal Adaptive Graph Neural Expert Transformer (MAGNET), a fusion architecture that uses graph attention and a Mixture of Experts to generate unified, discriminative embeddings across modalities. To capture complex temporal dependencies, a lightweight T5 encoder only architecture is customized and adapted within this framework. Extensive experiments show that FedTime-MAGNET significantly improves HAR performance, achieving a centralized F1 Score of 0.934 and a strong federated F1 Score of 0.881. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining multimodal fusion, time series LLMs, and federated learning for building accurate and robust HAR systems.</p></details> |  |

We introduce PHAR-Post-hoc Attribution Rules-a unified framework that transforms numeric feature attributions from post-hoc, instance-wise explainers (e.g., LIME, SHAP) into structured, human-readable rules. These rules define interpretable intervals that indicate where and when key decision boundaries occur, enhancing model transparency. PHAR performs comparably to native rule-based methods, such as Anchor, while scaling more efficiently to long TS sequences and achieving broader instance coverage. A dedicated rule fusion step consolidates rule sets using strategies like weighted selection and lasso-based refinement, balancing key quality metrics: coverage, confidence, and simplicity. This fusion ensures each instance receives a concise and unambiguous rule, improving both explanation fidelity and consistency. We further introduce visualization techniques to illustrate specificity-generalization trade-offs in the derived rules. PHAR resolves conflicting and overlapping explanations-a common effect of the Rashomon phenomenon-into coherent, domain-adaptable insights. Comprehensive experiments on UCI datasets demonstrate that PHAR improves interpretability, decision transparency, and practical applicability for TS classification tasks.</p></details> |  |

While temporal-domain methods remain prevalent, frequency-domain approaches can effectively capture multi-scale periodic patterns, reduce sequence dependencies, and naturally denoise signals. However, existing approaches typically train model components for all frequencies under a unified training objective, often leading to mismatched learning speeds: high-frequency components converge faster and risk overfitting, while low-frequency components underfit due to insufficient training time. To deal with this challenge, we propose BEAT (Balanced frEquency Adaptive Tuning), a novel framework that dynamically monitors the training status for each frequency and adaptively adjusts their gradient updates. By recognizing convergence, overfitting, or underfitting for each frequency, BEAT dynamically reallocates learning priorities, moderating gradients for rapid learners and increasing those for slower ones, alleviating the tension between competing objectives across frequencies and synchronizing the overall learning process. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that BEAT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | 9 pages, 1 figure |

In wireless sensing, data scarcity and packet loss hinder efficient model training, while in wireless communication, high-dimensional CSI matrices and short coherent times caused by high mobility present challenges in CSI estimation.To address these issues, we propose a unified framework named CSI-BERT2 for CSI prediction and classification tasks. Building on CSI-BERT, we introduce a two-stage training method that first uses a mask language model (MLM) to enable the model to learn general feature extraction from scarce datasets in an unsupervised manner, followed by fine-tuning for specific downstream tasks. Specifically, we extend MLM into a mask prediction model (MPM), which efficiently addresses the CSI prediction task. We also introduce an adaptive re-weighting layer (ARL) to enhance subcarrier representation and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) based temporal embedding module to mitigate permutation invariance issues in time-series CSI data. This significantly improves the CSI classification performance of the original CSI-BERT model. Extensive experiments on both real-world collected and simulated datasets demonstrate that CSI-BERT2 achieves state-of-the-art performance across all tasks. Our results further show that CSI-BERT2 generalizes effectively across varying sampling rates and robustly handles discontinuous CSI sequences caused by packet loss-challenges that conventional methods fail to address.</p></details> |  |
| **[KANMixer: Can KAN Serve as a New Modeling Core for Long-term Time Series Forecasting?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01575v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, multilayer perceptrons (MLP)-based deep learning models have demonstrated remarkable success in long-term time series forecasting (LTSF). Existing approaches typically augment MLP backbones with hand-crafted external modules to address the inherent limitations of their flat architectures. Despite their success, these augmented methods neglect hierarchical locality and sequential inductive biases essential for time-series modeling, and recent studies indicate diminishing performance improvements. To overcome these limitations, we explore Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), a recently proposed model featuring adaptive basis functions capable of granular, local modulation of nonlinearities. This raises a fundamental question: Can KAN serve as a new modeling core for LTSF? To answer this, we introduce KANMixer, a concise architecture integrating a multi-scale mixing backbone that fully leverages KAN's adaptive capabilities. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that KANMixer achieves state-of-the-art performance in 16 out of 28 experiments across seven benchmark datasets. To uncover the reasons behind this strong performance, we systematically analyze the strengths and limitations of KANMixer in comparison with traditional MLP architectures. Our findings reveal that the adaptive flexibility of KAN's learnable basis functions significantly transforms the influence of network structural prior on forecasting performance. Furthermore, we identify critical design factors affecting forecasting accuracy and offer practical insights for effectively utilizing KAN in LTSF.

| **[Prototype Learning to Create Refined Interpretable Digital Phenotypes from ECGs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01521v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prototype-based neural networks offer interpretable predictions by comparing inputs to learned, representative signal patterns anchored in training data. While such models have shown promise in the classification of physiological data, it remains unclear whether their prototypes capture an underlying structure that aligns with broader clinical phenotypes. We use a prototype-based deep learning model trained for multi-label ECG classification using the PTB-XL dataset. Then without modification we performed inference on the MIMIC-IV clinical database. We assess whether individual prototypes, trained solely for classification, are associated with hospital discharge diagnoses in the form of phecodes in this external population. Individual prototypes demonstrate significantly stronger and more specific associations with clinical outcomes compared to the classifier's class predictions, NLP-extracted concepts, or broader prototype classes across all phecode categories. Prototype classes with mixed significance patterns exhibit significantly greater intra-class distances (p $<$ 0.0001), indicating the model learned to differentiate clinically meaningful variations within diagnostic categories. The prototypes achieve strong predictive performance across diverse conditions, with AUCs ranging from 0.89 for atrial fibrillation to 0.91 for heart failure, while also showing substantial signal for non-cardiac conditions such as sepsis and renal disease. These findings suggest that prototype-based models can support interpretable digital phenotyping from physiologic time-series data, providing transferable intermediate phenotypes that capture clinically meaningful physiologic signatures beyond their original training objectives.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; under review</p></details> |
| **[Frequency-Constrained Learning for Long-Term Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01508v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world time series exhibit strong periodic structures arising from physical laws, human routines, or seasonal cycles. However, modern deep forecasting models often fail to capture these recurring patterns due to spectral bias and a lack of frequency-aware inductive priors. Motivated by this gap, we propose a simple yet effective method that enhances long-term forecasting by explicitly modeling periodicity through spectral initialization and frequency-constrained optimization. Specifically, we extract dominant low-frequency components via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-guided coordinate descent, initialize sinusoidal embeddings with these components, and employ a two-speed learning schedule to preserve meaningful frequency structure during training. Our approach is model-agnostic and integrates seamlessly into existing Transformer-based architectures. Extensive experiments across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains--particularly at long horizons--highlighting the benefits of injecting spectral priors into deep temporal models for robust and interpretable long-range forecasting. Moreover, on synthetic data, our method accurately recovers ground-truth frequencies, further validating its interpretability and effectiveness in capturing latent periodic patterns.</p></details> |  |
| **[Instruction-based Time Series Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01504v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In time series editing, we aim to modify some properties of a given time series without altering others. For example, when analyzing a hospital patient's blood pressure, we may add a sudden early drop and observe how it impacts their future while preserving other conditions. Existing diffusion-based editors rely on rigid, predefined attribute vectors as conditions and produce all-or-nothing edits through sampling. This attribute- and sampling-based approach limits flexibility in condition format and lacks customizable control over editing strength. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Instruction-based Time Series Editing, where users specify intended edits using natural language. This allows users to express a wider range of edits in a more accessible format. We then introduce InstructTime, the first instruction-based time series editor. InstructTime takes in time series and instructions, embeds them into a shared multi-modal representation space, then decodes their embeddings to generate edited time series. By learning a structured multi-modal representation space, we can easily interpolate between embeddings to achieve varying degrees of edit. To handle local and global edits together, we propose multi-resolution encoders. In our experiments, we use synthetic and real datasets and find that InstructTime is a state-of-the-art time series editor: InstructTime achieves high-quality edits with controllable strength, can generalize to unseen instructions, and can be easily adapted to unseen conditions through few-shot learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[HT-Transformer: Event Sequences Classification by Accumulating Prefix Information with History Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01474v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in modeling sequential data, including event sequences, temporal point processes, and irregular time series. Recently, transformers have largely replaced recurrent networks in these tasks. However, transformers often underperform RNNs in classification tasks where the objective is to predict future targets. The reason behind this performance gap remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we identify a key limitation of transformers: the absence of a single state vector that provides a compact and effective representation of the entire sequence. Additionally, we show that contrastive pretraining of embedding vectors fails to capture local context, which is crucial for accurate prediction. To address these challenges, we introduce history tokens, a novel concept that facilitates the accumulation of historical information during next-token prediction pretraining. Our approach significantly improves transformer-based models, achieving impressive results in finance, e-commerce, and healthcare tasks. The code is publicly available on GitHub.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-Driven Discovery of Mobility Periodicity for Understanding Urban Transportation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03747v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uncovering the temporal regularity of human mobility is crucial for discovering urban dynamics and has implications for various decision-making processes and urban system applications. This study formulates the periodicity quantification problem in complex and multidimensional human mobility data as a sparse identification of dominant positive auto-correlations in time series autoregression, allowing one to discover and quantify significant periodic patterns such as weekly periodicity from a data-driven and interpretable machine learning perspective. We apply our framework to real-world human mobility data, including metro passenger flow in Hangzhou, China and ridesharing trips in New York City (NYC) and Chicago, USA, revealing the interpretable weekly periodicity across different spatial locations over past several years. In particular, our analysis of ridesharing data from 2019 to 2024 demonstrates the disruptive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mobility regularity and the subsequent recovery trends, highlighting differences in the recovery pattern percentages and speeds between NYC and Chicago. We explore that both NYC and Chicago experienced a remarkable reduction of weekly periodicity in 2020, and the recovery of mobility regularity in NYC is faster than Chicago. The interpretability of sparse autoregression provides insights into the underlying temporal patterns of human mobility, offering a valuable tool for understanding urban systems. Our findings highlight the potential of interpretable machine learning to unlock crucial insights from real-world mobility data.</p></details> |  |

We present CPformer, a Concept- and Physics-enhanced Transformer that channels every prediction through five self-supervised, domain-agnostic concepts while enforcing differentiable residuals drawn from first-principle constraints. Unlike prior efficiency-oriented Transformers that rely purely on sparsity or frequency priors , CPformer combines latent transparency with hard scientific guidance while retaining attention for long contexts. We tested CPformer on six publicly-available datasets: sub-hourly Electricity and Traffic, hourly ETT, high-dimensional Weather, weekly Influenza-like Illness, and minute-level Exchange Rate, and CPformer achieves the lowest error in eight of twelve MSE/MAE cells. Relative to the strongest Transformer baseline (FEDformer), CPformer reduces mean-squared-error by 23% on Electricity, 44% on Traffic and 61% on Illness, while matching performance on strictly periodic Weather and ETT series.</p></details> |  |
| **[Kronos: A Foundation Model for the Language of Financial Markets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02739v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of large-scale pre-training paradigm, exemplified by Large Language Models (LLMs), has inspired the development of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs). However, their application to financial candlestick (K-line) data remains limited, often underperforming non-pre-trained architectures. Moreover, existing TSFMs often overlook crucial downstream tasks such as volatility prediction and synthetic data generation. To address these limitations, we propose Kronos, a unified, scalable pre-training framework tailored to financial K-line modeling. Kronos introduces a specialized tokenizer that discretizes continuous market information into token sequences, preserving both price dynamics and trade activity patterns. We pre-train Kronos using an autoregressive objective on a massive, multi-market corpus of over 12 billion K-line records from 45 global exchanges, enabling it to learn nuanced temporal and cross-asset representations. Kronos excels in a zero-shot setting across a diverse set of financial tasks. On benchmark datasets, Kronos boosts price series forecasting RankIC by 93% over the leading TSFM and 87% over the best non-pre-trained baseline. It also achieves a 9% lower MAE in volatility forecasting and a 22% improvement in generative fidelity for synthetic K-line sequences. These results establish Kronos as a robust, versatile foundation model for end-to-end financial time series analysis. Our pre-trained model is publicly available at https://github.com/shiyu-coder/Kronos.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompting Large Language Models for Training-Free Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06330v3)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) aims to disaggregate total electricity consumption into individual appliance usage, thus enabling more effective energy management. While deep learning has advanced NILM, it remains limited by its dependence on labeled data, restricted generalization, and lack of explainability. This paper introduces the first prompt-based NILM framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) with in-context learning. We design and evaluate prompt strategies that integrate appliance features, contextual information, and representative time-series examples through extensive case studies. Extensive experiments on the REDD and UK-DALE datasets show that LLMs guided solely by prompts deliver only basic NILM capabilities, with performance that lags behind traditional deep-learning models in complex scenarios. However, the experiments also demonstrate strong generalization across different houses and even regions by simply adapting the injected appliance features. It also provides clear, human-readable explanations for the inferred appliance states. Our findings define the capability boundaries of using prompt-only LLMs for NILM tasks. Their strengths in generalization and explainability present a promising new direction for the field.</p></details> |  |

While many existing state-of-practice methods have greatly advanced the dynamic mapping of exposure and hazard, our understanding of large-scale physical vulnerability has remained static, costly, limited, region-specific, coarse-grained, overly aggregated, and inadequately calibrated. With the significant growth in the availability of time-series satellite imagery and derived products for exposure and hazard, we focus our work on the equally important yet challenging element of the risk equation: physical vulnerability. We leverage machine learning methods that flexibly capture spatial contextual relationships, limited temporal observations, and uncertainty in a unified probabilistic spatiotemporal inference framework. We therefore introduce Graph Variational State-Space Model (GraphVSSM), a novel modular spatiotemporal approach that uniquely integrates graph deep learning, state-space modeling, and variational inference using time-series data and prior expert belief systems in a weakly supervised or coarse-to-fine-grained manner. We present three major results: a city-wide demonstration in Quezon City, Philippines; an investigation of sudden changes in the cyclone-impacted coastal Khurushkul community (Bangladesh) and mudslide-affected Freetown (Sierra Leone); and an open geospatial dataset, METEOR 2.5D, that spatiotemporally enhances the existing global static dataset for UN Least Developed Countries (2020). Beyond advancing regional disaster resilience assessment and improving our understanding global disaster risk reduction progress, our method also offers a probabilistic deep learning approach, contributing to broader urban studies that require compositional data analysis in weak supervision.</p></details> | <details><summary>Non-p...</summary><p>Non-peer-reviewed Preprint | Keywords: graph state-space model, building exposure, physical vulnerability, weak supervision, probabilistic model, disaster resilience, risk audit | Code: https://github.com/riskaudit/GraphVSSM | Quezon City (Philippines) Dataset: https://doi.org/pzj2 | METEOR 2.5D Dataset, https://doi.org/pzq4, https://doi.org/pzrd | Khurushkul-Freetown Dataset: https://doi.org/pzkw</p></details> |
| **[Generalisation Bounds of Zero-Shot Economic Forecasting using Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15705v2)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates zero-shot forecasting capabilities of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) for macroeconomic indicators. We apply TSFMs to forecasting economic indicators under univariate conditions, bypassing the need for train bespoke econometric models using and extensive training datasets. Our experiments were conducted on a case study dataset, without additional customisation. We rigorously back-tested three state-of-the-art TSFMs (Chronos, TimeGPT and Moirai) under data-scarce conditions and structural breaks. Our results demonstrate that appropriately engineered TSFMs can internalise rich economic dynamics, accommodate regime shifts, and deliver well-behaved uncertainty estimates out of the box, while matching state-of-the-art multivariate models on this domain. Our findings suggest that, without any fine-tuning, TSFMs can match or exceed classical models during stable economic conditions. However, they are vulnerable to degradation in performances during periods of rapid shocks. The findings offer guidance to practitioners on when zero-shot deployments are viable for macroeconomic monitoring and strategic planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fourier Basis Mapping: A Time-Frequency Learning Framework for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09445v2)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Fourier transform and deep learning opens new avenues for time series forecasting. We reconsider the Fourier transform from a basis functions perspective. Specifically, the real and imaginary parts of the frequency components can be regarded as the coefficients of cosine and sine basis functions at tiered frequency levels, respectively. We find that existing Fourier-based methods face inconsistent starting cycles and inconsistent series length issues. They fail to interpret frequency components precisely and overlook temporal information. Accordingly, the novel Fourier Basis Mapping (FBM) method addresses these issues by integrating time-frequency features through Fourier basis expansion and mapping in the time-frequency space. Our approach extracts explicit frequency features while preserving temporal characteristics. FBM supports plug-and-play integration with various types of neural networks by only adjusting the first initial projection layer for better performance. First, we propose FBM-L, FBM-NL, and FBM-NP to enhance linear, MLP-based, and Transformer-based models, respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of time-frequency features. Next, we propose a synergetic model architecture, termed FBM-S, which decomposes the seasonal, trend, and interaction effects into three separate blocks, each designed to model time-frequency features in a specialized manner. Finally, we introduce several techniques tailored for time-frequency features, including interaction masking, centralization, patching, rolling window projection, and multi-scale down-sampling. The results are validated on diverse real-world datasets for both long-term and short-term forecasting tasks with SOTA performance.</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Algorithmic Recourse in Abnormal Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16896v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Algorithmic recourse provides actionable recommendations to alter unfavorable predictions of machine learning models, enhancing transparency through counterfactual explanations. While significant progress has been made in algorithmic recourse for static data, such as tabular and image data, limited research explores recourse for multivariate time series, particularly for reversing abnormal time series. This paper introduces Recourse in time series Anomaly Detection (RecAD), a framework for addressing anomalies in multivariate time series using backtracking counterfactual reasoning. By modeling the causes of anomalies as external interventions on exogenous variables, RecAD predicts recourse actions to restore normal status as counterfactual explanations, where the recourse function, responsible for generating actions based on observed data, is trained using an end-to-end approach. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Time Series Forecasting via Multi-Level Text Alignment with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07360v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The adaptation of large language models (LLMs) to time series forecasting poses unique challenges, as time series data is continuous in nature, while LLMs operate on discrete tokens. Despite the success of LLMs in natural language processing (NLP) and other structured domains, aligning time series data with language-based representations while maintaining both predictive accuracy and interpretability remains a significant hurdle. Existing methods have attempted to reprogram time series data into text-based forms, but these often fall short in delivering meaningful, interpretable results. In this paper, we propose a multi-level text alignment framework for time series forecasting using LLMs that not only improves prediction accuracy but also enhances the interpretability of time series representations. Our method decomposes time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components, which are then reprogrammed into component-specific text representations. We introduce a multi-level alignment mechanism, where component-specific embeddings are aligned with pre-trained word tokens, enabling more interpretable forecasts. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in accuracy while providing good interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by DASFAA2025</p></details> |
| **[Rethinking Irregular Time Series Forecasting: A Simple yet Effective Baseline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11250v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The forecasting of irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) is a critical task in domains like healthcare and climate science. However, this task faces two significant hurdles: 1) the inherent non-uniformity and missing data in IMTS complicate the modeling of temporal dynamics, and 2) existing methods often rely on computationally expensive architectures. To address these dual challenges, we introduce APN, a general and efficient forecasting framework. At the core of APN is a novel Time-Aware Patch Aggregation (TAPA) module that introduces an aggregation-based paradigm for adaptive patching, moving beyond the limitations of fixed-span segmentation and interpolation-based methods. TAPA first learns dynamic temporal boundaries to define data-driven segments. Crucially, instead of resampling or interpolating, it directly computes patch representations via a time-aware weighted aggregation of all raw observations, where weights are determined by each observation's temporal relevance to the segment. This approach provides two key advantages: it preserves data fidelity by avoiding the introduction of artificial data points and ensures complete information coverage by design.The resulting regularized and information-rich patch representations enable the use of a lightweight query module for historical context aggregation and a simple MLP for final prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that APN establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Localized Sparse Principal Component Analysis of Multivariate Time Series in Frequency Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08177v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Principal component analysis has been a main tool in multivariate analysis for estimating a low dimensional linear subspace that explains most of the variability in the data. However, in high-dimensional regimes, naive estimates of the principal loadings are not consistent and difficult to interpret. In the context of time series, principal component analysis of spectral density matrices can provide valuable, parsimonious information about the behavior of the underlying process, particularly if the principal components are interpretable in that they are sparse in coordinates and localized in frequency bands. In this paper, we introduce a formulation and consistent estimation procedure for interpretable principal component analysis for high-dimensional time series in the frequency domain. An efficient frequency-sequential algorithm is developed to compute sparse-localized estimates of the low-dimensional principal subspaces of the signal process. The method is motivated by and used to understand neurological mechanisms from high-density resting-state EEG in a study of first episode psychosis.</p></details> | 63 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Multi-Band Variable-Lag Granger Causality: A Unified Framework for Causal Time Series Inference across Frequencies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00658v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding causal relationships in time series is fundamental to many domains, including neuroscience, economics, and behavioral science. Granger causality is one of the well-known techniques for inferring causality in time series. Typically, Granger causality frameworks have a strong fix-lag assumption between cause and effect, which is often unrealistic in complex systems. While recent work on variable-lag Granger causality (VLGC) addresses this limitation by allowing a cause to influence an effect with different time lags at each time point, it fails to account for the fact that causal interactions may vary not only in time delay but also across frequency bands. For example, in brain signals, alpha-band activity may influence another region with a shorter delay than slower delta-band oscillations. In this work, we formalize Multi-Band Variable-Lag Granger Causality (MB-VLGC) and propose a novel framework that generalizes traditional VLGC by explicitly modeling frequency-dependent causal delays. We provide a formal definition of MB-VLGC, demonstrate its theoretical soundness, and propose an efficient inference pipeline. Extensive experiments across multiple domains demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets, confirming its broad applicability to any type of time series data. Code and datasets are publicly available.</p></details> | First draft |

To address these limitations, we propose a novel task, Time-series Reasoning for Anomaly (Time-RA) that transforms classical time series anomaly detection from a discriminative into a generative, reasoning-intensive task leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). Also, we introduce the first real-world multimodal benchmark dataset, RATs40K, explicitly annotated for anomaly reasoning, comprising approximately 40,000 samples across 10 real-world domains. Each sample includes numeric time series data, contextual text information, and visual representations, each annotated with fine-grained categories (14 types for univariate anomalies and 6 for multivariate anomalies) and structured explanatory reasoning. We develop a sophisticated annotation framework utilizing ensemble-generated labels refined through GPT-4-driven feedback, ensuring accuracy and interpretability. Extensive benchmarking of LLMs and multimodal LLMs demonstrates the capabilities and limitations of current models, highlighting the critical role of supervised fine-tuning. Our dataset and task pave the way for significant advancements in interpretable time series anomaly detection and reasoning.

| **[A Novel Modeling Framework and Data Product for Extended VIIRS-like Artificial Nighttime Light Image Reconstruction (1986-2024)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00590v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial Night-Time Light (NTL) remote sensing is a vital proxy for quantifying the intensity and spatial distribution of human activities. Although the NPP-VIIRS sensor provides high-quality NTL observations, its temporal coverage, which begins in 2012, restricts long-term time-series studies that extend to earlier periods. Despite the progress in extending VIIRS-like NTL time-series, current methods still suffer from two significant shortcomings: the underestimation of light intensity and the structural omission. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel reconstruction framework consisting of a two-stage process: construction and refinement. The construction stage features a Hierarchical Fusion Decoder (HFD) designed to enhance the fidelity of the initial reconstruction. The refinement stage employs a Dual Feature Refiner (DFR), which leverages high-resolution impervious surface masks to guide and enhance fine-grained structural details. Based on this framework, we developed the Extended VIIRS-like Artificial Nighttime Light (EVAL) product for China, extending the standard data record backwards by 26 years to begin in 1986. Quantitative evaluation shows that EVAL significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art products, boosting the $\text{R}^2$ from 0.68 to 0.80 while lowering the RMSE from 1.27 to 0.99. Furthermore, EVAL exhibits excellent temporal consistency and maintains a high correlation with socioeconomic parameters, confirming its reliability for long-term analysis. The resulting EVAL dataset provides a valuable new resource for the research community and is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.11888/HumanNat.tpdc.302930.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing (im)balance in signed brain networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00542v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many complex systems - be they financial, natural or social - are composed by units - such as stocks, neurons or agents - whose joint activity can be represented as a multivariate time series. An issue of both practical and theoretical importance concerns the possibility of inferring the presence of a static relationships between any two units solely from their dynamic state. The present contribution aims at providing an answer within the frame of traditional hypothesis testing. Briefly speaking, our suggestion is that of linking any two units if behaving in a sufficiently similar way. To achieve such a goal, we project a multivariate time series onto a signed graph, by i) comparing the empirical properties of the former with those expected under a suitable benchmark and ii) linking any two units with a positive (negative) edge in case the corresponding series share a significantly large number of concordant (discordant) values. To define our benchmarks, we adopt an information-theoretic approach that is rooted into the constrained maximisation of Shannon entropy, a procedure inducing an ensemble of multivariate time series that preserves some of the empirical properties on average while randomising everything else. We showcase the possible applications of our method by addressing one of the most timely issues in the domain of neurosciences, i.e. that of determining if brain networks are frustrated or not - and, in case, to what extent. As our results suggest, this is indeed the case, the structure of the negative subgraph being more prone to inter-subject variability than the complementary, positive subgraph. At the mesoscopic level, instead, the minimisation of the Bayesian Information Criterion instantiated with the Signed Stochastic Block Model reveals that brain areas gather into modules aligning with the statistical variant of the Relaxed Balance Theory.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 17 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
