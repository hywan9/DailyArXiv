| **[Sensitivity Analysis of Priors in the Bayesian Dirichlet Auto-Regressive Moving Average Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13973v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prior choice can strongly influence Bayesian Dirichlet ARMA (B-DARMA) inference for compositional time-series. Using simulations with (i) correct lag order, (ii) overfitting, and (iii) underfitting, we assess five priors: weakly-informative, horseshoe, Laplace, mixture-of-normals, and hierarchical. With the true lag order, all priors achieve comparable RMSE, though horseshoe and hierarchical slightly reduce bias. Under overfitting, aggressive shrinkage-especially the horseshoe-suppresses noise and improves forecasts, yet no prior rescues a model that omits essential VAR or VMA terms. We then fit B-DARMA to daily SP 500 sector weights using an intentionally large lag structure. Shrinkage priors curb spurious dynamics, whereas weakly-informative priors magnify errors in volatile sectors. Two lessons emerge: (1) match shrinkage strength to the degree of overparameterization, and (2) prioritize correct lag selection, because no prior repairs structural misspecification. These insights guide prior selection and model complexity management in high-dimensional compositional time-series applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Warping and Matching Subsequences Between Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15452v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Comparing time series is essential in various tasks such as clustering and classification. While elastic distance measures that allow warping provide a robust quantitative comparison, a qualitative comparison on top of them is missing. Traditional visualizations focus on point-to-point alignment and do not convey the broader structural relationships at the level of subsequences. This limitation makes it difficult to understand how and where one time series shifts, speeds up or slows down with respect to another. To address this, we propose a novel technique that simplifies the warping path to highlight, quantify and visualize key transformations (shift, compression, difference in amplitude). By offering a clearer representation of how subsequences match between time series, our method enhances interpretability in time series comparison.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous Relationships of Subjects and Shapelets for Semi-supervised Multivariate Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18043v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series (MTS) classification is widely applied in fields such as industry, healthcare, and finance, aiming to extract key features from complex time series data for accurate decision-making and prediction. However, existing methods for MTS often struggle due to the challenges of effectively modeling high-dimensional data and the lack of labeled data, resulting in poor classification performance. To address this issue, we propose a heterogeneous relationships of subjects and shapelets method for semi-supervised MTS classification. This method offers a novel perspective by integrating various types of additional information while capturing the relationships between them. Specifically, we first utilize a contrast temporal self-attention module to obtain sparse MTS representations, and then model the similarities between these representations using soft dynamic time warping to construct a similarity graph. Secondly, we learn the shapelets for different subject types, incorporating both the subject features and their shapelets as additional information to further refine the similarity graph, ultimately generating a heterogeneous graph. Finally, we use a dual level graph attention network to get prediction. Through this method, we successfully transform dataset into a heterogeneous graph, integrating multiple additional information and achieving precise semi-supervised node classification. Experiments on the Human Activity Recognition, sleep stage classification and University of East Anglia datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in MTS classification tasks, validating its superiority.</p></details> | <details><summary>We wo...</summary><p>We would like to request the withdrawal of our manuscript due to logical errors in the paper</p></details> |
| **[Contrast Similarity-Aware Dual-Pathway Mamba for Multivariate Time Series Node Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12222v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series (MTS) data is generated through multiple sensors across various domains such as engineering application, health monitoring, and the internet of things, characterized by its temporal changes and high dimensional characteristics. Over the past few years, many studies have explored the long-range dependencies and similarities in MTS. However, long-range dependencies are difficult to model due to their temporal changes and high dimensionality makes it difficult to obtain similarities effectively and efficiently. Thus, to address these issues, we propose contrast similarity-aware dual-pathway Mamba for MTS node classification (CS-DPMamba). Firstly, to obtain the dynamic similarity of each sample, we initially use temporal contrast learning module to acquire MTS representations. And then we construct a similarity matrix between MTS representations using Fast Dynamic Time Warping (FastDTW). Secondly, we apply the DPMamba to consider the bidirectional nature of MTS, allowing us to better capture long-range and short-range dependencies within the data. Finally, we utilize the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network enhanced Graph Isomorphism Network to complete the information interaction in the matrix and MTS node classification task. By comprehensively considering the long-range dependencies and dynamic similarity features, we achieved precise MTS node classification. We conducted experiments on multiple University of East Anglia (UEA) MTS datasets, which encompass diverse application scenarios. Our results demonstrate the superiority of our method through both supervised and semi-supervised experiments on the MTS classification task.</p></details> | <details><summary>We wo...</summary><p>We would like to request the withdrawal of our manuscript due to logical errors in the paper</p></details> |
| **[Implementation and Assessment of Machine Learning Models for Forecasting Suspected Opioid Overdoses in Emergency Medical Services Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16500v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present efforts in the fields of machine learning and time series forecasting to accurately predict counts of future suspected opioid overdoses recorded by Emergency Medical Services (EMS) in the state of Kentucky. Forecasts help government agencies properly prepare and distribute resources related to opioid overdoses. Our approach uses county and district level aggregations of suspected opioid overdose encounters and forecasts future counts for different time intervals. Models with different levels of complexity were evaluated to minimize forecasting error. A variety of additional covariates relevant to opioid overdoses and public health were tested to determine their impact on model performance. Our evaluation shows that useful predictions can be generated with limited error for different types of regions, and high performance can be achieved using commonly available covariates and relatively simple forecasting models.</p></details> |  |
| **[EnergyDiff: Universal Time-Series Energy Data Generation using Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13538v3)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-resolution time series data are crucial for the operation and planning of energy systems such as electrical power systems and heating systems. Such data often cannot be shared due to privacy concerns, necessitating the use of synthetic data. However, high-resolution time series data is difficult to model due to its inherent high dimensionality and complex temporal dependencies. Leveraging the recent development of generative AI, especially diffusion models, we propose EnergyDiff, a universal data generation framework for energy time series data. EnergyDiff builds on state-of-the-art denoising diffusion probabilistic models, utilizing a proposed denoising network dedicated to high-resolution time series data and introducing a novel Marginal Calibration technique. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that EnergyDiff achieves significant improvement in capturing the temporal dependencies and marginal distributions compared to baselines, particularly at the 1-minute resolution. EnergyDiff's universality is validated across diverse energy domains (e.g., electricity demand, heat pump, PV, multiple time resolutions (1 minute, 15 minutes, 30 minutes and 1 hour), and at both customer and transformer levels.</p></details> | 15 pages |
| **[Oscillatory State-Space Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03943v3)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Linear Oscillatory State-Space models (LinOSS) for efficiently learning on long sequences. Inspired by cortical dynamics of biological neural networks, we base our proposed LinOSS model on a system of forced harmonic oscillators. A stable discretization, integrated over time using fast associative parallel scans, yields the proposed state-space model. We prove that LinOSS produces stable dynamics only requiring nonnegative diagonal state matrix. This is in stark contrast to many previous state-space models relying heavily on restrictive parameterizations. Moreover, we rigorously show that LinOSS is universal, i.e., it can approximate any continuous and causal operator mapping between time-varying functions, to desired accuracy. In addition, we show that an implicit-explicit discretization of LinOSS perfectly conserves the symmetry of time reversibility of the underlying dynamics. Together, these properties enable efficient modeling of long-range interactions, while ensuring stable and accurate long-horizon forecasting. Finally, our empirical results, spanning a wide range of time-series tasks from mid-range to very long-range classification and regression, as well as long-horizon forecasting, demonstrate that our proposed LinOSS model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art sequence models. Notably, LinOSS outperforms Mamba and LRU by nearly 2x on a sequence modeling task with sequences of length 50k.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 (Oral) |
| **[Stable CDE Autoencoders with Acuity Regularization for Offline Reinforcement Learning in Sepsis Treatment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15019v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective reinforcement learning (RL) for sepsis treatment depends on learning stable, clinically meaningful state representations from irregular ICU time series. While previous works have explored representation learning for this task, the critical challenge of training instability in sequential representations and its detrimental impact on policy performance has been overlooked. This work demonstrates that Controlled Differential Equations (CDE) state representation can achieve strong RL policies when two key factors are met: (1) ensuring training stability through early stopping or stabilization methods, and (2) enforcing acuity-aware representations by correlation regularization with clinical scores (SOFA, SAPS-II, OASIS). Experiments on the MIMIC-III sepsis cohort reveal that stable CDE autoencoder produces representations strongly correlated with acuity scores and enables RL policies with superior performance (WIS return $> 0.9$). In contrast, unstable CDE representation leads to degraded representations and policy failure (WIS return $\sim$ 0). Visualizations of the latent space show that stable CDEs not only separate survivor and non-survivor trajectories but also reveal clear acuity score gradients, whereas unstable training fails to capture either pattern. These findings highlight practical guidelines for using CDEs to encode irregular medical time series in clinical RL, emphasizing the need for training stability in sequential representation learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IJCAI2025 AI4TS</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing Battery and Line Undergrounding Investments for Transmission Systems under Wildfire Risk Scenarios: A Benders Decomposition Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06687v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With electric power infrastructure posing an increasing risk of igniting wildfires under continuing climate change, utilities are frequently de-energizing power lines to mitigate wildfire ignition risk, which can cause load shedding. Recent research advocates for installing battery energy storage systems as well as undergrounding risky overhead lines to reduce the load shedding during such de-energizations. Since wildfire ignition risk can exhibit substantial geographic and temporal variations, it is important to plan battery installation and line undergrounding investments while considering multiple possible scenarios. This paper presents a scenario-based framework for optimizing battery installation and line undergrounding investments while considering many scenarios, each consisting of a day-long time series of uncertain parameters for the load demand, renewable generation, and wildfire ignition risks. This problem is difficult to solve due to a large number of scenarios and binary variables associated with the battery placements as well as the lines to be undergrounded. To address the computational challenges, we decompose the problem in a two-stage scheme via a Benders decomposition approach. The first stage is a master problem formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model that makes decisions on the locations and sizes of batteries as well as the lines to be undergrounded. The second stage consists of a linear programming model that assesses these battery and line undergrounding decisions as modeled by a DC OPF formulation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme on a large-scale transmission network with real world data on wildfire ignition risks, load, and renewable generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Semi-Supervised Approach for Abnormal Event Prediction on Large Operational Network Time-Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07660v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large network logs, recording multivariate time series generated from heterogeneous devices and sensors in a network, can often reveal important information about abnormal activities, such as network intrusions and device malfunctions. Existing machine learning methods for anomaly detection on multivariate time series typically assume that 1) normal sequences would have consistent behavior for training unsupervised models, or 2) require a large set of labeled normal and abnormal sequences for supervised models. However, in practice, normal network activities can demonstrate significantly varying sequence patterns (e.g., before and after rerouting partial network traffic). Also, the recorded abnormal events can be sparse. This paper presents a novel semi-supervised method that efficiently captures dependencies between network time series and across time points to generate meaningful representations of network activities for predicting abnormal events. The method can use the limited labeled data to explicitly learn separable embedding space for normal and abnormal samples and effectively leverage unlabeled data to handle training data scarcity. The experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperformed state-of-the-art approaches for event detection on a large real-world network log.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE BigData2022</p></details> |
| **[Early Prediction of Multiple Sclerosis Disability Progression via Multimodal Foundation Model Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14986v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early multiple sclerosis (MS) disability progression prediction is challenging due to disease heterogeneity. This work predicts 48- and 72-week disability using sparse baseline clinical data and 12 weeks of daily digital Floodlight data from the CONSONANCE clinical trial. We employed state-of-the-art tabular and time-series foundation models (FMs), a custom multimodal attention-based transformer, and machine learning methods. Despite the difficulty of early prediction (AUROC 0.63), integrating digital data via advanced models improved performance over clinical data alone. A transformer model using unimodal embeddings from the Moment FM yielded the best result, but our multimodal transformer consistently outperformed its unimodal counterpart, confirming the advantages of combining clinical with digital data. Our findings demonstrate the promise of FMs and multimodal approaches to extract predictive signals from complex and diverse clinical and digital life sciences data (e.g., imaging, omics), enabling more accurate prognostics for MS and potentially other complex diseases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IJCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Missing data in non-stationary multivariate time series from digital studies in Psychiatry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14946v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile technology (e.g., mobile phones and wearable devices) provides scalable methods for collecting physiological and behavioral biomarkers in patients' naturalistic settings, as well as opportunities for therapeutic advancements and scientific discoveries regarding the etiology of psychiatric illness. Continuous data collection through mobile devices generates highly complex data: entangled multivariate time series of outcomes, exposures, and covariates. Missing data is a pervasive problem in biomedical and social science research, and Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) data in psychiatric research is no exception. However, the complex data structure of multivariate time series and their non-stationary nature make missing data a major challenge for proper inference. Additional historical information included in time series analyses exacerbates the issue of missing data and also introduces problems for confounding adjustment. The majority of existing imputation methods are either designed for stationary time series or for longitudinal data with limited follow-up periods. The limited work on non-stationary time series either focuses on missing exogenous information or ignores the complex temporal dependence among outcomes, exposures, and covariates. We propose a Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization algorithm for the state space model (MCEM-SSM) to effectively handle missing data in non-stationary entangled multivariate time series. We demonstrate the method's advantages over other widely used missing data imputation strategies through simulations of both stationary and non-stationary time series, subject to various missing mechanisms. Finally, we apply the MCEM-SSM to a multi-year smartphone observational study of bipolar and schizophrenia patients to investigate the association between digital social connectivity and negative mood.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identifiability by common backdoor in summary causal graphs of time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14862v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The identifiability problem for interventions aims at assessing whether the total effect of some given interventions can be written with a do-free formula, and thus be computed from observational data only. We study this problem, considering multiple interventions and multiple effects, in the context of time series when only abstractions of the true causal graph in the form of summary causal graphs are available. We focus in this study on identifiability by a common backdoor set, and establish, for time series with and without consistency throughout time, conditions under which such a set exists. We also provide algorithms of limited complexity to decide whether the problem is identifiable or not.</p></details> |  |
| **[When are dynamical systems learned from time series data statistically accurate?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06311v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional notions of generalization often fail to describe the ability of learned models to capture meaningful information from dynamical data. A neural network that learns complex dynamics with a small test error may still fail to reproduce its \emph{physical} behavior, including associated statistical moments and Lyapunov exponents. To address this gap, we propose an ergodic theoretic approach to generalization of complex dynamical models learned from time series data. Our main contribution is to define and analyze generalization of a broad suite of neural representations of classes of ergodic systems, including chaotic systems, in a way that captures emulating underlying invariant, physical measures. Our results provide theoretical justification for why regression methods for generators of dynamical systems (Neural ODEs) fail to generalize, and why their statistical accuracy improves upon adding Jacobian information during training. We verify our results on a number of ergodic chaotic systems and neural network parameterizations, including MLPs, ResNets, Fourier Neural layers, and RNNs.</p></details> | in NeuRIPS 2024 |

We study this problem, considering multiple interventions, in the context of time series when only an abstraction of the true causal graph, in the form of a summary causal graph, is available. We propose in particular both necessary and sufficient conditions for the adjustment criterion, which we show is complete in this setting, and provide a pseudo-linear algorithm to decide whether the query is identifiable or not.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 41st Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI)</p></details> |
| **[Leveraging External Factors in Household-Level Electrical Consumption Forecasting using Hypernetworks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14472v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate electrical consumption forecasting is crucial for efficient energy management and resource allocation. While traditional time series forecasting relies on historical patterns and temporal dependencies, incorporating external factors -- such as weather indicators -- has shown significant potential for improving prediction accuracy in complex real-world applications. However, the inclusion of these additional features often degrades the performance of global predictive models trained on entire populations, despite improving individual household-level models. To address this challenge, we found that a hypernetwork architecture can effectively leverage external factors to enhance the accuracy of global electrical consumption forecasting models, by specifically adjusting the model weights to each consumer. We collected a comprehensive dataset spanning two years, comprising consumption data from over 6000 luxembourgish households and corresponding external factors such as weather indicators, holidays, and major local events. By comparing various forecasting models, we demonstrate that a hypernetwork approach outperforms existing methods when associated to external factors, reducing forecasting errors and achieving the best accuracy while maintaining the benefits of a global model.</p></details> | ECML PKDD 2025 |
| **[Enhancing Forecasting Accuracy in Dynamic Environments via PELT-Driven Drift Detection and Model Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14133v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate time series forecasting models are often compromised by data drift, where underlying data distributions change over time, leading to significant declines in prediction performance. To address this challenge, this study proposes an adaptive forecasting framework that integrates drift detection with targeted model retraining to compensate for drift effects. The framework utilizes the Pruned Exact Linear Time (PELT) algorithm to identify drift points within the feature space of time series data. Once drift intervals are detected, selective retraining is applied to prediction models using Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Lasso Regressor architectures, allowing the models to adjust to changing data patterns. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated on two datasets: a real-world dataset containing electricity consumption and HVAC system data, and a synthetic financial dataset designed to test cross-domain applicability. Initial baseline models were developed without drift detection using extensive feature engineering. After integrating drift-aware retraining, the MLP model achieved a 44% reduction in mean absolute error (MAE) and a 39% increase in R^2 on the real-world dataset, while even greater improvements were observed on the synthetic financial dataset. Similar enhancements were achieved with the Lasso Regressor. These results highlight the robustness and generalizability of incorporating drift detection and adaptive retraining to sustain forecasting accuracy across diverse domains.</p></details> | 18 pages |
| **[Haptic-Based User Authentication for Tele-robotic System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14116v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tele-operated robots rely on real-time user behavior mapping for remote tasks, but ensuring secure authentication remains a challenge. Traditional methods, such as passwords and static biometrics, are vulnerable to spoofing and replay attacks, particularly in high-stakes, continuous interactions. This paper presents a novel anti-spoofing and anti-replay authentication approach that leverages distinctive user behavioral features extracted from haptic feedback during human-robot interactions. To evaluate our authentication approach, we collected a time-series force feedback dataset from 15 participants performing seven distinct tasks. We then developed a transformer-based deep learning model to extract temporal features from the haptic signals. By analyzing user-specific force dynamics, our method achieves over 90 percent accuracy in both user identification and task classification, demonstrating its potential for enhancing access control and identity assurance in tele-robotic systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[SKOLR: Structured Koopman Operator Linear RNN for Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14113v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Koopman operator theory provides a framework for nonlinear dynamical system analysis and time-series forecasting by mapping dynamics to a space of real-valued measurement functions, enabling a linear operator representation. Despite the advantage of linearity, the operator is generally infinite-dimensional. Therefore, the objective is to learn measurement functions that yield a tractable finite-dimensional Koopman operator approximation. In this work, we establish a connection between Koopman operator approximation and linear Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which have recently demonstrated remarkable success in sequence modeling. We show that by considering an extended state consisting of lagged observations, we can establish an equivalence between a structured Koopman operator and linear RNN updates. Building on this connection, we present SKOLR, which integrates a learnable spectral decomposition of the input signal with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) as the measurement functions and implements a structured Koopman operator via a highly parallel linear RNN stack. Numerical experiments on various forecasting benchmarks and dynamical systems show that this streamlined, Koopman-theory-based design delivers exceptional performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Scale Finetuning for Encoder-based Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14087v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series foundation models (TSFMs) demonstrate impressive zero-shot performance for time series forecasting. However, an important yet underexplored challenge is how to effectively finetune TSFMs on specific downstream tasks. While naive finetuning can yield performance gains, we argue that it falls short of fully leveraging TSFMs' capabilities, often resulting in overfitting and suboptimal performance. Given the diverse temporal patterns across sampling scales and the inherent multi-scale forecasting capabilities of TSFMs, we adopt a causal perspective to analyze finetuning process, through which we highlight the critical importance of explicitly modeling multiple scales and reveal the shortcomings of naive approaches. Focusing on \textit{encoder-based} TSFMs, we propose \textbf{M}ulti\textbf{\textsc{s}}cale \textbf{\textsc{f}}ine\textbf{\textsc{t}}uning (\textbf{MSFT}), a simple yet general framework that explicitly integrates multi-scale modeling into the finetuning process. Experimental results on three different backbones (\moirai, \moment\ and \units) demonstrate that TSFMs finetuned with MSFT not only outperform naive and typical parameter efficient finetuning methods but also surpass state-of-the-art deep learning methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[FEWSim: A Visual Analytic Framework for Exploring the Nexus of Food-Energy-Water Simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14056v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The interdependencies of food, energy, and water (FEW) systems create a nexus opportunity to explore the strengths and vulnerabilities of individual and cross-sector interactions within FEW systems. However, the variables quantifying nexus interactions are hard to observe, which hinders the cross-sector analysis. To overcome such challenges, we present FEWSim, a visual analytics framework designed to support domain experts in exploring and interpreting simulation results from a coupled FEW model. FEWSim employs a three-layer asynchronous architecture: the model layer integrates food, energy, and water models to simulate the FEW nexus; the middleware layer manages scenario configuration and execution; and the visualization layer provides interactive visual exploration of simulated time-series results across FEW sectors. The visualization layer further facilitates the exploration across multiple scenarios and evaluates scenario differences in performance using sustainability indices of the FEW nexus. We demonstrate the utility of FEWSim through a case study for the Phoenix Active Management Area (AMA) in Arizona.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications (CG&A)</p></details> |
| **[Rademacher learning rates for iterated random functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13946v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing literature on supervised machine learning assumes that the training dataset is drawn from an i.i.d. sample. However, many real-world problems exhibit temporal dependence and strong correlations between the marginal distributions of the data-generating process, suggesting that the i.i.d. assumption is often unrealistic. In such cases, models naturally include time-series processes with mixing properties, as well as irreducible and aperiodic ergodic Markov chains. Moreover, the learning rates typically obtained in these settings are independent of the data distribution, which can lead to restrictive choices of hypothesis classes and suboptimal sample complexities for the learning algorithm. In this article, we consider the case where the training dataset is generated by an iterated random function (i.e., an iteratively defined time-homogeneous Markov chain) that is not necessarily irreducible or aperiodic. Under the assumption that the governing function is contractive with respect to its first argument and subject to certain regularity conditions on the hypothesis class, we first establish a uniform convergence result for the corresponding sample error. We then demonstrate the learnability of the approximate empirical risk minimization algorithm and derive its learning rate bound. Both rates are data-distribution dependent, expressed in terms of the Rademacher complexities of the underlying hypothesis class, allowing them to more accurately reflect the properties of the data-generating distribution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Few-Shot Learning for Industrial Time Series: A Comparative Analysis Using the Example of Screw-Fastening Process Monitoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13909v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot learning (FSL) has shown promise in vision but remains largely unexplored for \emph{industrial} time-series data, where annotating every new defect is prohibitively expensive. We present a systematic FSL study on screw-fastening process monitoring, using a 2\,300-sample multivariate torque dataset that covers 16 uni- and multi-factorial defect types. Beyond benchmarking, we introduce a \textbf{label-aware episodic sampler} that collapses multi-label sequences into multiple single-label tasks, keeping the output dimensionality fixed while preserving combinatorial label information. Two FSL paradigms are investigated: the metric-based \emph{Prototypical Network} and the gradient-based \emph{Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning} (MAML), each paired with three backbones: 1D CNN, InceptionTime and the 341 M-parameter transformer \emph{Moment}. On 10-shot, 3-way evaluation, the InceptionTime + Prototypical Network combination achieves a \textbf{0.944 weighted F1} in the multi-class regime and \textbf{0.935} in the multi-label regime, outperforming finetuned Moment by up to 5.3\% while requiring two orders of magnitude fewer parameters and training time. Across all backbones, metric learning consistently surpasses MAML, and our label-aware sampling yields an additional 1.7\% F1 over traditional class-based sampling. These findings challenge the assumption that large foundation models are always superior: when data are scarce, lightweight CNN architectures augmented with simple metric learning not only converge faster but also generalize better. We release code, data splits and pre-trained weights to foster reproducible research and to catalyze the adoption of FSL in high-value manufacturing inspection.</p></details> |  |
| **[OPTIMUS: Observing Persistent Transformations in Multi-temporal Unlabeled Satellite-data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13902v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the face of pressing environmental issues in the 21st century, monitoring surface changes on Earth is more important than ever. Large-scale remote sensing, such as satellite imagery, is an important tool for this task. However, using supervised methods to detect changes is difficult because of the lack of satellite data annotated with change labels, especially for rare categories of change. Annotation proves challenging due to the sparse occurrence of changes in satellite images. Even within a vast collection of images, only a small fraction may exhibit persistent changes of interest. To address this challenge, we introduce OPTIMUS, a self-supervised learning method based on an intuitive principle: if a model can recover information about the relative order of images in the time series, then that implies that there are long-lasting changes in the images. OPTIMUS demonstrates this principle by using change point detection methods on model outputs in a time series. We demonstrate that OPTIMUS can directly detect interesting changes in satellite images, achieving an improvement in AUROC score from 56.3% to 87.6% at distinguishing changed time series from unchanged ones compared to baselines. Our code and dataset are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/optimus-change/optimus-dataset/.</p></details> | WACV 2025 |
| **[TimeMaster: Training Time-Series Multimodal LLMs to Reason via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13705v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series reasoning remains a significant challenge in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) due to the dynamic temporal patterns, ambiguous semantics, and lack of temporal priors. In this work, we introduce TimeMaster, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based method that enables time-series MLLMs to perform structured, interpretable reasoning directly over visualized time-series inputs and task prompts. TimeMaster adopts a three-part structured output format, reasoning, classification, and domain-specific extension, and is optimized via a composite reward function that aligns format adherence, prediction accuracy, and open-ended insight quality. The model is trained using a two-stage pipeline: we first apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to establish a good initialization, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) at the token level to enable stable and targeted reward-driven improvement in time-series reasoning. We evaluate TimeMaster on the TimerBed benchmark across six real-world classification tasks based on Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct. TimeMaster achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming both classical time-series models and few-shot GPT-4o by over 14.6% and 7.3% performance gain, respectively. Notably, TimeMaster goes beyond time-series classification: it also exhibits expert-like reasoning behavior, generates context-aware explanations, and delivers domain-aligned insights. Our results highlight that reward-driven RL can be a scalable and promising path toward integrating temporal understanding into time-series MLLMs.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Deep Learning for Wildfire Risk Prediction: Integrating Remote Sensing and Environmental Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01607v5)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wildfires pose a significant threat to ecosystems, wildlife, and human communities, leading to habitat destruction, pollutant emissions, and biodiversity loss. Accurate wildfire risk prediction is crucial for mitigating these impacts and safeguarding both environmental and human health. This paper provides a comprehensive review of wildfire risk prediction methodologies, with a particular focus on deep learning approaches combined with remote sensing. We begin by defining wildfire risk and summarizing the geographical distribution of related studies. In terms of data, we analyze key predictive features, including fuel characteristics, meteorological and climatic conditions, socioeconomic factors, topography, and hydrology, while also reviewing publicly available wildfire prediction datasets derived from remote sensing. Additionally, we emphasize the importance of feature collinearity assessment and model interpretability to improve the understanding of prediction outcomes. Regarding methodology, we classify deep learning models into three primary categories: time-series forecasting, image segmentation, and spatiotemporal prediction, and further discuss methods for converting model outputs into risk classifications or probability-adjusted predictions. Finally, we identify the key challenges and limitations of current wildfire-risk prediction models and outline several research opportunities. These include integrating diverse remote sensing data, developing multimodal models, designing more computationally efficient architectures, and incorporating cross-disciplinary methods--such as coupling with numerical weather-prediction models--to enhance the accuracy and robustness of wildfire-risk assessments.</p></details> |  |

While traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) remains the cornerstone of operational forecasting, machine learning is emerging as a powerful alternative for fast, flexible, and scalable predictions. We introduce PeakWeather, a high-quality dataset of surface weather observations collected every 10 minutes over more than 8 years from the ground stations of the Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology MeteoSwiss's measurement network. The dataset includes a diverse set of meteorological variables from 302 station locations distributed across Switzerland's complex topography and is complemented with topographical indices derived from digital height models for context. Ensemble forecasts from the currently operational high-resolution NWP model are provided as a baseline forecast against which to evaluate new approaches. The dataset's richness supports a broad spectrum of spatiotemporal tasks, including time series forecasting at various scales, graph structure learning, imputation, and virtual sensing. As such, PeakWeather serves as a real-world benchmark to advance both foundational machine learning research, meteorology, and sensor-based applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoIFNet: A Unified Framework for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Missing Values](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13064v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) is a critical task with broad applications in domains such as meteorology, transportation, and economics. Nevertheless, pervasive missing values caused by sensor failures or human errors significantly degrade forecasting accuracy. Prior efforts usually employ an impute-then-forecast paradigm, leading to suboptimal predictions due to error accumulation and misaligned objectives between the two stages. To address this challenge, we propose the Collaborative Imputation-Forecasting Network (CoIFNet), a novel framework that unifies imputation and forecasting to achieve robust MTSF in the presence of missing values. Specifically, CoIFNet takes the observed values, mask matrix and timestamp embeddings as input, processing them sequentially through the Cross-Timestep Fusion (CTF) and Cross-Variate Fusion (CVF) modules to capture temporal dependencies that are robust to missing values. We provide theoretical justifications on how our CoIFNet learning objective improves the performance bound of MTSF with missing values. Through extensive experiments on challenging MSTF benchmarks, we demonstrate the effectiveness and computational efficiency of our proposed approach across diverse missing-data scenarios, e.g., CoIFNet outperforms the state-of-the-art method by $\underline{\textbf{24.40}}$% ($\underline{\textbf{23.81}}$%) at a point (block) missing rate of 0.6, while improving memory and time efficiency by $\underline{\boldsymbol{4.3\times}}$ and $\underline{\boldsymbol{2.1\times}}$, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Explainability in the Era of Multimodal AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13060v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While multimodal AI systems (models jointly trained on heterogeneous data types such as text, time series, graphs, and images) have become ubiquitous and achieved remarkable performance across high-stakes applications, transparent and accurate explanation algorithms are crucial for their safe deployment and ensure user trust. However, most existing explainability techniques remain unimodal, generating modality-specific feature attributions, concepts, or circuit traces in isolation and thus failing to capture cross-modal interactions. This paper argues that such unimodal explanations systematically misrepresent and fail to capture the cross-modal influence that drives multimodal model decisions, and the community should stop relying on them for interpreting multimodal models. To support our position, we outline key principles for multimodal explanations grounded in modality: Granger-style modality influence (controlled ablations to quantify how removing one modality changes the explanation for another), Synergistic faithfulness (explanations capture the model's predictive power when modalities are combined), and Unified stability (explanations remain consistent under small, cross-modal perturbations). This targeted shift to multimodal explanations will help the community uncover hidden shortcuts, mitigate modality bias, improve model reliability, and enhance safety in high-stakes settings where incomplete explanations can have serious consequences.</p></details> |  |
| **[Forecast-Then-Optimize Deep Learning Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13036v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting underpins vital decision-making across various sectors, yet raw predictions from sophisticated models often harbor systematic errors and biases. We examine the Forecast-Then-Optimize (FTO) framework, pioneering its systematic synopsis. Unlike conventional Predict-Then-Optimize (PTO) methods, FTO explicitly refines forecasts through optimization techniques such as ensemble methods, meta-learners, and uncertainty adjustments. Furthermore, deep learning and large language models have established superiority over traditional parametric forecasting models for most enterprise applications. This paper surveys significant advancements from 2016 to 2025, analyzing mainstream deep learning FTO architectures. Focusing on real-world applications in operations management, we demonstrate FTO's crucial role in enhancing predictive accuracy, robustness, and decision efficacy. Our study establishes foundational guidelines for future forecasting methodologies, bridging theory and operational practicality.</p></details> | 44 pages, 2 figures |
| **[SpaceTrack-TimeSeries: Time Series Dataset towards Satellite Orbit Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13034v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of aerospace technology and the large-scale deployment of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations, the challenges facing astronomical observations and deep space exploration have become increasingly pronounced. As a result, the demand for high-precision orbital data on space objects-along with comprehensive analyses of satellite positioning, constellation configurations, and deep space satellite dynamics-has grown more urgent. However, there remains a notable lack of publicly accessible, real-world datasets to support research in areas such as space object maneuver behavior prediction and collision risk assessment. This study seeks to address this gap by collecting and curating a representative dataset of maneuvering behavior from Starlink satellites. The dataset integrates Two-Line Element (TLE) catalog data with corresponding high-precision ephemeris data, thereby enabling a more realistic and multidimensional modeling of space object behavior. It provides valuable insights into practical deployment of maneuver detection methods and the evaluation of collision risks in increasingly congested orbital environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Forecasting Time Series with LLMs via Patch-Based Prompting and Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12953v1)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated new possibilities for accurate and efficient time series analysis, but prior work often required heavy fine-tuning and/or ignored inter-series correlations. In this work, we explore simple and flexible prompt-based strategies that enable LLMs to perform time series forecasting without extensive retraining or the use of a complex external architecture. Through the exploration of specialized prompting methods that leverage time series decomposition, patch-based tokenization, and similarity-based neighbor augmentation, we find that it is possible to enhance LLM forecasting quality while maintaining simplicity and requiring minimal preprocessing of data. To this end, we propose our own method, PatchInstruct, which enables LLMs to make precise and effective predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model-Agnostic, Temperature-Informed Sampling Enhances Cross-Year Crop Mapping with Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12885v1)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional benchmarks for crop type classification from optical satellite time series typically assume access to labeled data from the same year and rely on fixed calendar-day sampling. This limits generalization across seasons, where crop phenology shifts due to interannual climate variability, and precludes real-time application when current-year labels are unavailable. Furthermore, uncertainty quantification is often neglected, making such approaches unreliable for crop monitoring applications. Inspired by ecophysiological principles of plant growth, we propose a simple, model-agnostic sampling strategy that leverages growing degree days (GDD), based on daily average temperature, to replace calendar time with thermal time. By uniformly subsampling time series in this biologically meaningful domain, the method emphasizes phenologically active growth stages while reducing temporal redundancy and noise. We evaluate the method on a multi-year Sentinel-2 dataset spanning all of Switzerland, training on one growing season and testing on other seasons. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our method delivers substantial gains in classification accuracy and, critically, produces more calibrated uncertainty estimates. Notably, our method excels in low-data regimes and enables significantly more accurate early-season classification. With only 10 percent of the training data, our method surpasses the state-of-the-art baseline in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty estimation, and by the end of June, it achieves performance similar to a baseline trained on the full season. These results demonstrate that leveraging temperature data not only improves predictive performance across seasons but also enhances the robustness and trustworthiness of crop-type mapping in real-world applications.</p></details> | under review |
| **[Lyapunov Learning at the Onset of Chaos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12810v1)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Handling regime shifts and non-stationary time series in deep learning systems presents a significant challenge. In the case of online learning, when new information is introduced, it can disrupt previously stored data and alter the model's overall paradigm, especially with non-stationary data sources. Therefore, it is crucial for neural systems to quickly adapt to new paradigms while preserving essential past knowledge relevant to the overall problem. In this paper, we propose a novel training algorithm for neural networks called \textit{Lyapunov Learning}. This approach leverages the properties of nonlinear chaotic dynamical systems to prepare the model for potential regime shifts. Drawing inspiration from Stuart Kauffman's Adjacent Possible theory, we leverage local unexplored regions of the solution space to enable flexible adaptation. The neural network is designed to operate at the edge of chaos, where the maximum Lyapunov exponent, indicative of a system's sensitivity to small perturbations, evolves around zero over time. Our approach demonstrates effective and significant improvements in experiments involving regime shifts in non-stationary systems. In particular, we train a neural network to deal with an abrupt change in Lorenz's chaotic system parameters. The neural network equipped with Lyapunov learning significantly outperforms the regular training, increasing the loss ratio by about $96\%$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025, HiLD: High-dimensional Learning Dynamics Workshop</p></details> |

This review covers aspects of LHF in this period and how deep learning has incorporated variants of trend, seasonality, fourier and wavelet transforms, misspecification bias reduction and bandpass filters while contributing using convolutions, residual connections, sparsity reduction, strided convolutions, attention masks, SSMs, normalization methods, low-rank approximations and gating mechanisms. We highlight time series decomposition techniques, input data preprocessing and dataset windowing schemes that improve performance. Multi-layer perceptron models, recurrent neural network hybrids, self-attention models that improve and/or address the performances of the LHF problem are described, with an emphasis on the feature space construction. Ablation studies are conducted over the ETTm2 dataset in the multivariate and univariate high useful load (HUFL) forecasting contexts, evaluated over the last 4 months of the dataset. The heatmaps of MSE averages per time step over test set series in the horizon show that there is a steady increase in the error proportionate to its length except with xLSTM and Triformer models and motivate LHF as an error propagation problem.

In clinical practice, dynamic time series data, such as lab test results, capture critical temporal patterns, while clinical notes provide rich semantic context. Merging these modalities is challenging due to the inherent differences between continuous signals and discrete text. To bridge this gap, we introduce ProMedTS, a novel self-supervised multimodal framework that employs prompt-guided learning to unify these heterogeneous data types. Our approach leverages lightweight anomaly detection to generate anomaly captions that serve as prompts, guiding the encoding of raw time series data into informative prompt embeddings. These prompt embeddings are aligned with textual representations in a shared latent space, preserving fine-grained temporal nuances alongside semantic insights. Furthermore, our framework incorporates tailored self-supervised objectives to enhance both intra- and inter-modal alignment. We evaluate ProMedTS on disease diagnosis tasks using real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by ACL2025(Findings)</p></details> |
| **[MetaEformer: Unveiling and Leveraging Meta-patterns for Complex and Dynamic Systems Load Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12800v1)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is a critical and practical problem in many real-world applications, especially for industrial scenarios, where load forecasting underpins the intelligent operation of modern systems like clouds, power grids and traffic networks.However, the inherent complexity and dynamics of these systems present significant challenges. Despite advances in methods such as pattern recognition and anti-non-stationarity have led to performance gains, current methods fail to consistently ensure effectiveness across various system scenarios due to the intertwined issues of complex patterns, concept-drift, and few-shot problems. To address these challenges simultaneously, we introduce a novel scheme centered on fundamental waveform, a.k.a., meta-pattern. Specifically, we develop a unique Meta-pattern Pooling mechanism to purify and maintain meta-patterns, capturing the nuanced nature of system loads. Complementing this, the proposed Echo mechanism adaptively leverages the meta-patterns, enabling a flexible and precise pattern reconstruction. Our Meta-pattern Echo transformer (MetaEformer) seamlessly incorporates these mechanisms with the transformer-based predictor, offering end-to-end efficiency and interpretability of core processes. Demonstrating superior performance across eight benchmarks under three system scenarios, MetaEformer marks a significant advantage in accuracy, with a 37% relative improvement on fifteen state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge-Augmented Multimodal Clinical Rationale Generation for Disease Diagnosis with Small Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07611v4)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interpretation is critical for disease diagnosis, but existing models struggle to balance predictive accuracy with human-understandable rationales. While large language models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning abilities, their clinical use is limited by high computational costs and restricted multimodal reasoning ability. Small language models (SLMs) are efficient but lack advanced reasoning for integrating multimodal medical data. In addition, both LLMs and SLMs lack domain knowledge for trustworthy reasoning. Therefore, we propose ClinRaGen, enhancing SLMs by leveraging LLM-derived reasoning ability via rationale distillation and domain knowledge injection for trustworthy multimodal rationale generation. Key innovations include a sequential rationale distillation framework that equips SLMs with LLM-comparable multimodal reasoning abilities, and a knowledge-augmented attention mechanism that jointly unifies multimodal representation from time series and textual data in the same encoding space, enabling it to be naturally interpreted by SLMs while incorporating domain knowledge for reliable rationale generation. Experiments on real-world medical datasets show that ClinRaGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in disease diagnosis and rationale generation, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining LLM-driven reasoning with knowledge augmentation for improved interpretability.</p></details> | 13 pages. 7 figures |

Accurate forecasting is critical for monitoring these phenomena and supporting mitigation strategies. While recent data-driven models for time-series forecasting, including CNNs, RNNs, and attention-based transformers, have shown promise, they often struggle with sequential dependencies and limited parallelization, especially in long-horizon, multivariate meteorological datasets. In this work, we present Focal Modulated Attention Encoder (FATE), a novel transformer architecture designed for reliable multivariate time-series forecasting. Unlike conventional models, FATE introduces a tensorized focal modulation mechanism that explicitly captures spatiotemporal correlations in time-series data. We further propose two modulation scores that offer interpretability by highlighting critical environmental features influencing predictions. We benchmark FATE across seven diverse real-world datasets including ETTh1, ETTm2, Traffic, Weather5k, USA-Canada, Europe, and LargeST datasets, and show that it consistently outperforms all state-of-the-art methods, including temperature datasets. Our ablation studies also demonstrate that FATE generalizes well to broader multivariate time-series forecasting tasks.

| **[Discovering Latent Causal Graphs from Spatiotemporal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05331v3)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many important phenomena in scientific fields like climate, neuroscience, and epidemiology are naturally represented as spatiotemporal gridded data with complex interactions. Inferring causal relationships from these data is a challenging problem compounded by the high dimensionality of such data and the correlations between spatially proximate points. We present SPACY (SPAtiotemporal Causal discoverY), a novel framework based on variational inference, designed to model latent time series and their causal relationships from spatiotemporal data. SPACY alleviates the high-dimensional challenge by discovering causal structures in the latent space. To aggregate spatially proximate, correlated grid points, we use spatial factors, parametrized by spatial kernel functions, to map observational time series to latent representations. Theoretically, we generalize the problem to a continuous spatial domain and establish identifiability when the observations arise from a nonlinear, invertible function of the product of latent series and spatial factors. Using this approach, we avoid assumptions that are often unverifiable, including those about instantaneous effects or sufficient variability. Empirically, SPACY outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on synthetic data, even in challenging settings where existing methods struggle, while remaining scalable for large grids. SPACY also identifies key known phenomena from real-world climate data. An implementation of SPACY is available at https://github.com/Rose-STL-Lab/SPACY/</p></details> |  |
| **[TFKAN: Time-Frequency KAN for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12696v1)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are highly effective in long-term time series forecasting due to their ability to efficiently represent nonlinear relationships and exhibit local plasticity. However, prior research on KANs has predominantly focused on the time domain, neglecting the potential of the frequency domain. The frequency domain of time series data reveals recurring patterns and periodic behaviors, which complement the temporal information captured in the time domain. To address this gap, we explore the application of KANs in the frequency domain for long-term time series forecasting. By leveraging KANs' adaptive activation functions and their comprehensive representation of signals in the frequency domain, we can more effectively learn global dependencies and periodic patterns. To integrate information from both time and frequency domains, we propose the $\textbf{T}$ime-$\textbf{F}$requency KAN (TFKAN). TFKAN employs a dual-branch architecture that independently processes features from each domain, ensuring that the distinct characteristics of each domain are fully utilized without interference. Additionally, to account for the heterogeneity between domains, we introduce a dimension-adjustment strategy that selectively upscales only in the frequency domain, enhancing efficiency while capturing richer frequency information. Experimental results demonstrate that TFKAN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across multiple datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/LcWave/TFKAN.</p></details> | 11 pages,5 figures |

Ford, with its 37 plants globally, uses 17 billion parts annually to manufacture six million cars and trucks. With up to ten tiers of suppliers between the company and raw materials, any extended disruption in this supply chain can cause substantial financial losses. Therefore, the ability to forecast and identify such disruptions early is crucial for maintaining seamless operations. In this study, we demonstrate how we construct a dataset consisting of many multivariate time series to forecast first-tier supply chain disruptions, utilizing features related to capacity, inventory, utilization, and processing, as outlined in the classical Factory Physics framework. This dataset is technically challenging due to its vast scale of over five hundred thousand time series. Furthermore, these time series, while exhibiting certain similarities, also display heterogeneity within specific subgroups. To address these challenges, we propose a novel methodology that integrates an enhanced Attention Sequence to Sequence Deep Learning architecture, using Neural Network Embeddings to model group effects, with a Survival Analysis model. This model is designed to learn intricate heterogeneous data patterns related to operational disruptions. Our model has demonstrated a strong performance, achieving 0.85 precision and 0.8 recall during the Quality Assurance (QA) phase across Ford's five North American plants. Additionally, to address the common criticism of Machine Learning models as black boxes, we show how the SHAP framework can be used to generate feature importance from the model predictions. It offers valuable insights that can lead to actionable strategies and highlights the potential of advanced machine learning for managing and mitigating supply chain risks in the automotive industry.</p></details> |  |

While prior work targeting Microcontroller Units (MCUs) has explored hardware-specific optimizations, such approaches are often task-specific and limited to 8-bit fixed-point precision. Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offer greater flexibility, enabling fine-grained control over data precision and architecture. However, existing FPGA-based deployments of Transformers for time-series analysis typically focus on high-density platforms with manual configuration. This paper presents a unified and fully automated deployment framework for Tiny Transformers on embedded FPGAs. Our framework supports a compact encoder-only Transformer architecture across three representative time-series tasks (forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection). It combines quantization-aware training (down to 4 bits), hardware-aware hyperparameter search using Optuna, and automatic VHDL generation for seamless deployment. We evaluate our framework on six public datasets across two embedded FPGA platforms. Results show that our framework produces integer-only, task-specific Transformer accelerators achieving as low as 0.033 mJ per inference with millisecond latency on AMD Spartan-7, while also providing insights into deployment feasibility on Lattice iCE40. All source code will be released in the GitHub repository (https://github.com/Edwina1030/TinyTransformer4TS).</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, accepted by IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI (ISVLSI 2025)</p></details> |

However, these large models typically process videos by averaging embedding outputs from multiple clips over time to produce fixed-length representations. This approach fails to account for a variety of time-related features, such as variable video durations, chronological order of events, and temporal variance in feature significance. While methods for temporal modeling do exist, they often require significant architectural changes and expensive retraining, making them impractical for off-the-shelf, fine-tuned large encoders. To overcome these limitations, we propose DejaVid, an encoder-agnostic method that enhances model performance without the need for retraining or altering the architecture. Our framework converts a video into a variable-length temporal sequence of embeddings, which we call a multivariate time series (MTS). An MTS naturally preserves temporal order and accommodates variable video durations. We then learn per-timestep, per-feature weights over the encoded MTS frames, allowing us to account for variations in feature importance over time. We introduce a new neural network architecture inspired by traditional time series alignment algorithms for this learning task. Our evaluation demonstrates that DejaVid substantially improves the performance of a state-of-the-art large encoder, achieving leading Top-1 accuracy of 77.2% on Something-Something V2, 89.1% on Kinetics-400, and 88.6% on HMDB51, while adding fewer than 1.8% additional learnable parameters and requiring less than 3 hours of training time.

Existing data contribution methods have been applied to various data types, including tabular data, images, and text; however, their primary focus has been on i.i.d. settings. Despite the pressing need for principled approaches tailored to time series datasets, the problem of estimating data contribution in such settings remains under-explored, possibly due to challenges associated with handling inherent temporal dependencies. This paper introduces TimeInf, a model-agnostic data contribution estimation method for time-series datasets. By leveraging influence scores, TimeInf attributes model predictions to individual time points while preserving temporal structures between the time points. Our empirical results show that TimeInf effectively detects time series anomalies and outperforms existing data attribution techniques as well as state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods. Moreover, TimeInf offers interpretable attributions of data values, allowing us to distinguish diverse anomalous patterns through visualizations. We also showcase a potential application of TimeInf in identifying mislabeled anomalies in the ground truth annotations.</p></details> |  |

Recently, deep learning-based MTSF models have gained significant attention for their promising ability to mine semantics (global and local information) within MTS data. However, these models are pervasively susceptible to missing values caused by malfunctioning data collectors. These missing values not only disrupt the semantics of MTS, but their distribution also changes over time. Nevertheless, existing models lack robustness to such issues, leading to suboptimal forecasting performance. To this end, in this paper, we propose Multi-View Representation Learning (Merlin), which can help existing models achieve semantic alignment between incomplete observations with different missing rates and complete observations in MTS. Specifically, Merlin consists of two key modules: offline knowledge distillation and multi-view contrastive learning. The former utilizes a teacher model to guide a student model in mining semantics from incomplete observations, similar to those obtainable from complete observations. The latter improves the student model's robustness by learning from positive/negative data pairs constructed from incomplete observations with different missing rates, ensuring semantic alignment across different missing rates. Therefore, Merlin is capable of effectively enhancing the robustness of existing models against unfixed missing rates while preserving forecasting accuracy. Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of Merlin.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGKDD 2025 (Research Track)</p></details> |

Existing time series imputation approaches primarily focus on the single-domain setting, which cannot effectively adapt to a new domain with domain shifts. Meanwhile, conventional domain adaptation techniques struggle with data incompleteness, as they typically assume the data from both source and target domains are fully observed to enable adaptation. For the problem of cross-domain time series imputation, missing values introduce high uncertainty that hinders distribution alignment, making existing adaptation strategies ineffective. Specifically, our proposed solution tackles this problem from three perspectives: (i) Data: We introduce a frequency-based time series interpolation strategy that integrates shared spectral components from both domains while retaining domain-specific temporal structures, constructing informative priors for imputation. (ii) Model: We design a diffusion-based imputation model that effectively learns domain-shared representations and captures domain-specific temporal dependencies with dedicated denoising networks. (iii) Algorithm: We further propose a cross-domain consistency alignment strategy that selectively regularizes output-level domain discrepancies, enabling effective knowledge transfer while preserving domain-specific characteristics. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach. Our code implementation is available here.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECML-PKDD 2025</p></details> |

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), initially developed for tasks like image and video recognition, have proven highly effectively in RUL prediction, demonstrating remarkable performance. However, with the emergence of the Vision Transformer (ViT), a Transformer model tailored for computer vision tasks such as image classification, and its demonstrated superiority over CNNs, there is a natural inclination to explore its potential in enhancing RUL prediction accuracy. Nonetheless, applying ViT directly to multivariate sensor data for RUL prediction poses challenges, primarily due to the ambiguous nature of spatial information in time series data. To address this issue, we introduce the PerFormer, a permutation-based vision transformer approach designed to permute multivariate time series data, mimicking spatial characteristics akin to image data, thereby making it suitable for ViT. To generate the desired permutation matrix, we introduce a novel permutation loss function aimed at guiding the convergence of any matrix towards a permutation matrix. Our experiments on NASA's C-MAPSS dataset demonstrate the PerFormer's superior performance in RUL prediction compared to state-of-the-art methods employing CNNs, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and various Transformer models. This underscores its effectiveness and potential in PHM applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>One o...</summary><p>One of the coauthors does not want to post current version of paper, and insists to withdraw the submission</p></details> |

We leverage the connections between trajectory inference and continuous-time synthetic data generation, along with a computational method based on mean-field Langevin dynamics. As discretized mean-field Langevin dynamics and noisy particle gradient descent are equivalent, DP results for noisy SGD can be applied to our setting. We provide experiments that generate realistic trajectories on a synthesized variation of hand-drawn MNIST data while maintaining meaningful privacy guarantees. Crucially, our method has strong utility guarantees under the setting where each person contributes data for \emph{only one time point}, while prior methods require each person to contribute their \emph{entire temporal trajectory}--directly improving the privacy characteristics by construction.</p></details> |  |

While time series cross-validation (TSCV) techniques aim to preserve temporal ordering during model evaluation, their impact on classifier performance remains underexplored. This study systematically investigates the effect of TSCV strategy on the precision-recall characteristics of classifiers trained to detect fault-like anomalies in MTS datasets. We compare walk-forward (WF) and sliding window (SW) methods across a range of validation partition configurations and classifier types, including shallow learners and deep learning (DL) classifiers. Results show that SW consistently yields higher median AUC-PR scores and reduced fold-to-fold performance variance, particularly for deep architectures sensitive to localized temporal continuity. Furthermore, we find that classifier generalization is sensitive to the number and structure of temporal partitions, with overlapping windows preserving fault signatures more effectively at lower fold counts. A classifier-level stratified analysis reveals that certain algorithms, such as random forests (RF), maintain stable performance across validation schemes, whereas others exhibit marked sensitivity. This study demonstrates that TSCV design in benchmarking anomaly detection models on streaming time series and provide guidance for selecting evaluation strategies in temporally structured learning environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Variational Neural Stochastic Differential Equations with Change Points](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00635v2)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we explore modeling change points in time-series data using neural stochastic differential equations (neural SDEs). We propose a novel model formulation and training procedure based on the variational autoencoder (VAE) framework for modeling time-series as a neural SDE. Unlike existing algorithms training neural SDEs as VAEs, our proposed algorithm only necessitates a Gaussian prior of the initial state of the latent stochastic process, rather than a Wiener process prior on the entire latent stochastic process. We develop two methodologies for modeling and estimating change points in time-series data with distribution shifts. Our iterative algorithm alternates between updating neural SDE parameters and updating the change points based on either a maximum likelihood-based approach or a change point detection algorithm using the sequential likelihood ratio test. We provide a theoretical analysis of this proposed change point detection scheme. Finally, we present an empirical evaluation that demonstrates the expressive power of our proposed model, showing that it can effectively model both classical parametric SDEs and some real datasets with distribution shifts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Why Do Class-Dependent Evaluation Effects Occur with Time Series Feature Attributions? A Synthetic Data Investigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11790v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating feature attribution methods represents a critical challenge in explainable AI (XAI), as researchers typically rely on perturbation-based metrics when ground truth is unavailable. However, recent work demonstrates that these evaluation metrics can show different performance across predicted classes within the same dataset. These "class-dependent evaluation effects" raise questions about whether perturbation analysis reliably measures attribution quality, with direct implications for XAI method development and the trustworthiness of evaluation techniques. We investigate under which conditions these class-dependent effects arise by conducting controlled experiments with synthetic time series data where ground truth feature locations are known. We systematically vary feature types and class contrasts across binary classification tasks, then compare perturbation-based degradation scores with ground truth-based precision-recall metrics using multiple attribution methods. Our experiments demonstrate that class-dependent effects emerge with both evaluation approaches even in simple scenarios with temporally localized features, triggered by basic variations in feature amplitude or temporal extent between classes. Most critically, we find that perturbation-based and ground truth metrics frequently yield contradictory assessments of attribution quality across classes, with weak correlations between evaluation approaches. These findings suggest that researchers should interpret perturbation-based metrics with care, as they may not always align with whether attributions correctly identify discriminating features. These findings reveal opportunities to reconsider what attribution evaluation actually measures and to develop more comprehensive evaluation frameworks that capture multiple dimensions of attribution quality.</p></details> |  |

To mitigate such shortcuts and prevent "Clever-Hans" moments in time series models, we introduce Right on Time (RioT), a novel method that enables interacting with model explanations across both the time and frequency domains. By incorporating feedback on explanations in both domains, RioT constrains the model, steering it away from annotated spurious correlations. This dual-domain interaction strategy is crucial for effectively addressing shortcuts in time series datasets. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of RioT in guiding models toward more reliable decision-making across popular time series classification and forecasting datasets, as well as our newly recorded dataset with naturally occuring shortcuts, P2S, collected from a real mechanical production line.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in ECML PKDD 2025</p></details> |

The advantages of FT, such as high efficiency and a global view, have been rapidly explored and exploited in various time series tasks and applications, demonstrating the promising potential of FT as a new deep learning paradigm for time series analysis. Despite the growing attention and the proliferation of research in this emerging field, there is currently a lack of a systematic review and in-depth analysis of deep learning-based time series models with FT. It is also unclear why FT can enhance time series analysis and what its limitations are in the field. To address these gaps, we present a comprehensive review that systematically investigates and summarizes the recent research advancements in deep learning-based time series analysis with FT. Specifically, we explore the primary approaches used in current models that incorporate FT, the types of neural networks that leverage FT, and the representative FT-equipped models in deep time series analysis. We propose a novel taxonomy to categorize the existing methods in this field, providing a structured overview of the diverse approaches employed in incorporating FT into deep learning models for time series analysis. Finally, we highlight the advantages and limitations of FT for time series modeling and identify potential future research directions that can further contribute to the community of time series analysis.</p></details> | Accepted By KDD 2025 |

The study is based on mastitis detection in dairy cows using a hypothetical herd management system. We designed four exemplary explanation formats for mastitis assessments with different types of presentation (textual, rule-based, herd comparison, and time series). In our previous study, 14 dairy farmers in Germany had rated these formats in terms of comprehensibility and the trust they would have in a system providing each format. In this study, we repeat the survey with 13 software providers active in the German dairy industry. We ask them how well they think the formats would be received by farmers. We hypothesized that there may be discrepancies between the views of both groups that are worth investigating, partly to find reasons for the reluctance to adopt digital systems. A comparison of the feedback from both groups supports the hypothesis and calls for further investigation. The results show that software providers tend to make assumptions about farmers' preferences that are not necessarily accurate. Our study, although not representative due to the small sample size, highlights the potential benefits of a thorough user requirements analysis (farmers' needs) to improve software adaptation and user acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IJCAI 2024, Explainable AI Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Functional-Coefficient Models for Multivariate Time Series in Designed Experiments: with Applications to Brain Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00292v3)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To study the neurophysiological basis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), clinicians use electroencephalography (EEG) which record neuronal electrical activity on the cortex. Instead of focusing on single-channel spectral power, a novel framework for investigating interactions (dependence) between channels in the entire network is proposed. Although dependence measures such as coherence and partial directed coherence (PDC) are well explored in studying brain connectivity, these measures only capture linear dependence. Moreover, in designed clinical experiments, these dependence measures are observed to vary across subjects even within a homogeneous group. To address these limitations, we propose the mixed-effects functional-coefficient autoregressive (MXFAR) model which captures between-subject variation by incorporating subject-specific random effects. The advantages of the MXFAR model are the following: (i) it captures potential non-linear dependence between channels; (ii) it is nonparametric and hence flexible and robust to model mis-specification; (iii) it can capture differences between groups when they exist; (iv) it accounts for variation across subjects; (v) the framework easily incorporates well-known inference methods from mixed-effects models; (vi) it can be generalized to accommodate various covariates and factors. Then, we formulate a novel non-linear spectral measure, the functional partial directed coherence (fPDC), to extract dynamic cross-dependence patterns at different frequency oscillations. Finally, we apply the proposed MXFAR-fPDC framework to analyze multichannel EEG signals and report novel findings on altered brain functional networks in ADHD patients.</p></details> |  |

Early detection of such events is essential for improving disaster response. In this work, we propose SITS-Extreme, a novel framework that leverages satellite image time series to detect extreme events by incorporating multiple pre-disaster observations. This approach effectively filters out irrelevant changes while isolating disaster-relevant signals, enabling more accurate detection. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of SITS-Extreme, demonstrating substantial improvements over widely used strong bi-temporal baselines. Additionally, we examine the impact of incorporating more timesteps, analyze the contribution of key components in our framework, and evaluate its performance across different disaster types, offering valuable insights into its scalability and applicability for large-scale disaster monitoring.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the WACV 2025 Workshop on GeoCV.

However, in the context of limited and noisy data, accurately predicting dynamics of all variables in a high-dimensional system is a challenging task due to their nonlinearity and also complex interactions. Current methods including deep learning approaches often perform poorly for real-world systems under such circumstances. This study introduces the Delayformer framework for simultaneously predicting dynamics of all variables, by developing a novel multivariate spatiotemporal information (mvSTI) transformation that makes each observed variable into a delay-embedded state (vector) and further cross-learns those states from different variables. From dynamical systems viewpoint, Delayformer predicts system states rather than individual variables, thus theoretically and computationally overcoming such nonlinearity and cross-interaction problems. Specifically, it first utilizes a single shared Visual Transformer (ViT) encoder to cross-represent dynamical states from observed variables in a delay embedded form and then employs distinct linear decoders for predicting next states, i.e. equivalently predicting all original variables parallelly. By leveraging the theoretical foundations of delay embedding theory and the representational capabilities of Transformers, Delayformer outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in forecasting tasks on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Furthermore, the potential of Delayformer as a foundational time-series model is demonstrated through cross-domain forecasting tasks, highlighting its broad applicability across various scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review</p></details> |

However, existing approaches typically focus on task-specific model customization, such as forecasting and anomaly detection, while overlooking the data itself, referred to as time-series primitives, which are essential for in-depth reasoning. This position paper advocates a fundamental shift in approaching time-series reasoning with LLMs: prioritizing alignment paradigms grounded in the intrinsic primitives of time series data over task-specific model customization. This realignment addresses the core limitations of current time-series reasoning approaches, which are often costly, inflexible, and inefficient, by systematically accounting for intrinsic structure of data before task engineering. To this end, we propose three alignment paradigms: Injective Alignment, Bridging Alignment, and Internal Alignment, which are emphasized by prioritizing different aspects of time-series primitives: domain, characteristic, and representation, respectively, to activate time-series reasoning capabilities of LLMs to enable economical, flexible, and efficient reasoning. We further recommend that practitioners adopt an alignment-oriented method to avail this instruction to select an appropriate alignment paradigm. Additionally, we categorize relevant literature into these alignment paradigms and outline promising research directions.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Two-step Estimating Approach for Heavy-tailed AR Models with General Non-zero Median Noises](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11509v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper develops a novel two-step estimating procedure for heavy-tailed AR models with non-zero median noises, allowing for time-varying volatility. We first establish the self-weighted quantile regression estimator (SQE) across all quantile levels $\tau\in (0,1)$ for the AR parameters $\theta_{0}$. We show that the SQE, minus a bias, converges weakly to a Gaussian process uniformly at a rate of $n^{-1/2}$. The bias is zero if and only if $\tau$ equals $\tau_{0}$, the probability that the noise is less than zero. Based on the SQE, we propose an approach to estimate $\tau_{0}$ in the second step and {feed the estimated $\hat{\tau}_n$ back into the SQE to estimate $\theta_0$.} Both the estimated $\tau_{0}$ and $\theta_{0}$ are shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal. A random weighting bootstrap method is developed to approximate the complicated distribution. The problem we study is non-standard because $\tau_{0}$ may not be identifiable in conventional quantile regression, and the usual methods cannot verify the existence of the SQE bias. Unlike existing procedures for heavy-tailed time series, our method does not require any classical identification conditions, such as zero-mean or zero-median.</p></details> |  |
| **[Voxel-Level Brain States Prediction Using Swin Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11455v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding brain dynamics is important for neuroscience and mental health. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) enables the measurement of neural activities through blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals, which represent brain states. In this study, we aim to predict future human resting brain states with fMRI. Due to the 3D voxel-wise spatial organization and temporal dependencies of the fMRI data, we propose a novel architecture which employs a 4D Shifted Window (Swin) Transformer as encoder to efficiently learn spatio-temporal information and a convolutional decoder to enable brain state prediction at the same spatial and temporal resolution as the input fMRI data. We used 100 unrelated subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) for model training and testing. Our novel model has shown high accuracy when predicting 7.2s resting-state brain activities based on the prior 23.04s fMRI time series. The predicted brain states highly resemble BOLD contrast and dynamics. This work shows promising evidence that the spatiotemporal organization of the human brain can be learned by a Swin Transformer model, at high resolution, which provides a potential for reducing the fMRI scan time and the development of brain-computer interfaces in the future.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we present a novel approach to generate large-scale, high-resolution canopy height maps over time. Our model accurately predicts canopy height over multiple years given Sentinel-1 composite and Sentinel~2 time series satellite data. Using GEDI LiDAR data as the ground truth for training the model, we present the first 10m resolution temporal canopy height map of the European continent for the period 2019-2022. As part of this product, we also offer a detailed canopy height map for 2020, providing more precise estimates than previous studies.

| **[Sensor Model Identification via Simultaneous Model Selection and State Variable Determination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11263v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a method for the unattended gray-box identification of sensor models commonly used by localization algorithms in the field of robotics. The objective is to determine the most likely sensor model for a time series of unknown measurement data, given an extendable catalog of predefined sensor models. Sensor model definitions may require states for rigid-body calibrations and dedicated reference frames to replicate a measurement based on the robot's localization state. A health metric is introduced, which verifies the outcome of the selection process in order to detect false positives and facilitate reliable decision-making. In a second stage, an initial guess for identified calibration states is generated, and the necessity of sensor world reference frames is evaluated. The identified sensor model with its parameter information is then used to parameterize and initialize a state estimation application, thus ensuring a more accurate and robust integration of new sensor elements. This method is helpful for inexperienced users who want to identify the source and type of a measurement, sensor calibrations, or sensor reference frames. It will also be important in the field of modular multi-agent scenarios and modularized robotic platforms that are augmented by sensor modalities during runtime. Overall, this work aims to provide a simplified integration of sensor modalities to downstream applications and circumvent common pitfalls in the usage and development of localization approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Time-Series Foundation Models Perform Building Energy Management Tasks?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11250v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building energy management (BEM) tasks require processing and learning from a variety of time-series data. Existing solutions rely on bespoke task- and data-specific models to perform these tasks, limiting their broader applicability. Inspired by the transformative success of Large Language Models (LLMs), Time-Series Foundation Models (TSFMs), trained on diverse datasets, have the potential to change this. Were TSFMs to achieve a level of generalizability across tasks and contexts akin to LLMs, they could fundamentally address the scalability challenges pervasive in BEM. To understand where they stand today, we evaluate TSFMs across four dimensions: (1) generalizability in zero-shot univariate forecasting, (2) forecasting with covariates for thermal behavior modeling, (3) zero-shot representation learning for classification tasks, and (4) robustness to performance metrics and varying operational conditions. Our results reveal that TSFMs exhibit \emph{limited} generalizability, performing only marginally better than statistical models on unseen datasets and modalities for univariate forecasting. Similarly, inclusion of covariates in TSFMs does not yield performance improvements, and their performance remains inferior to conventional models that utilize covariates. While TSFMs generate effective zero-shot representations for downstream classification tasks, they may remain inferior to statistical models in forecasting when statistical models perform test-time fitting. Moreover, TSFMs forecasting performance is sensitive to evaluation metrics, and they struggle in more complex building environments compared to statistical models. These findings underscore the need for targeted advancements in TSFM design, particularly their handling of covariates and incorporating context and temporal dynamics into prediction mechanisms, to develop more adaptable and scalable solutions for BEM.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 5 tables, 8 figures.

| **[Regularized Estimation of the Loading Matrix in Factor Models for High-Dimensional Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11232v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional data analysis using traditional models suffers from overparameterization. Two types of techniques are commonly used to reduce the number of parameters - regularization and dimension reduction. In this project, we combine them by imposing a sparse factor structure and propose a regularized estimator to further reduce the number of parameters in factor models. A challenge limiting the widespread application of factor models is that factors are hard to interpret, as both factors and the loading matrix are unobserved. To address this, we introduce a penalty term when estimating the loading matrix for a sparse estimate. As a result, each factor only drives a smaller subset of time series that exhibit the strongest correlation, improving the factor interpretability. The theoretical properties of the proposed estimator are investigated. The simulation results are presented to confirm that our algorithm performs well. We apply our method to Hawaii tourism data. The results indicate that two groups drive the number of domestic tourists in Hawaii: visitors from high-latitude states (factor 1) and visitors from inland or low-latitude states (factor 2). It reveals two main reasons people visit Hawaii: (1) to escape the cold and (2) to enjoy the beach and water activities.</p></details> |  |

The neuromorphic network used in this study is based on a complex electrical circuit comprised of memristive elements that produce neuro-synaptic nonlinear responses to input electrical signals. To determine how computation may be performed using the physics of the underlying system, the neuromorphic network was simulated and evaluated on autonomous prediction of a multivariate chaotic time series, implemented with a reservoir computing framework. Through manipulating only input electrodes and voltages, optimal nonlinear dynamical responses were found when input voltages maximise the number of memristive components whose internal dynamics explore the entire dynamical range of the memristor model. Increasing the network coverage with the input electrodes was found to suppress other nonlinear responses that are less conducive to learning. These results provide valuable insights into how a practical neuromorphic network device can be optimised for learning complex dynamical systems using only external control parameters.</p></details> | 37 pages, 22 figures |
| **[STOAT: Spatial-Temporal Probabilistic Causal Inference Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09544v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial-temporal causal time series (STC-TS) involve region-specific temporal observations driven by causally relevant covariates and interconnected across geographic or network-based spaces. Existing methods often model spatial and temporal dynamics independently and overlook causality-driven probabilistic forecasting, limiting their predictive power. To address this, we propose STOAT (Spatial-Temporal Probabilistic Causal Inference Network), a novel framework for probabilistic forecasting in STC-TS. The proposed method extends a causal inference approach by incorporating a spatial relation matrix that encodes interregional dependencies (e.g. proximity or connectivity), enabling spatially informed causal effect estimation. The resulting latent series are processed by deep probabilistic models to estimate the parameters of the distributions, enabling calibrated uncertainty modeling. We further explore multiple output distributions (e.g., Gaussian, Student's-$t$, Laplace) to capture region-specific variability. Experiments on COVID-19 data across six countries demonstrate that STOAT outperforms state-of-the-art probabilistic forecasting models (DeepAR, DeepVAR, Deep State Space Model, etc.) in key metrics, particularly in regions with strong spatial dependencies. By bridging causal inference and geospatial probabilistic forecasting, STOAT offers a generalizable framework for complex spatial-temporal tasks, such as epidemic management.</p></details> |  |

Although increasingly capable TSF methods occur, many of them require domain-specific data collection and model training and do not generalize well when applied in other domains. Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) that are pre-trained on massive heterogeneous time series data aim to overcome these limitations. The prospects for generalizability have spurred the development of a new generation of TSFMs. This study proposes a benchmark, TSFM-Bench, to facilitate comprehensive and unified evaluation of TSFMs. TSFM-Bench covers a wide range of TSFMs, including those based on large language models and those pre-trained on time series data. TSFM-Bench supports multiple forecasting scenarios, including zero-shot, few-shot, and full-shot, enabling assessment across the full range of adaptation strategies. TSFM-Bench also provides a standardized experimental protocols for critical evaluation processes such as dataset splitting, loading, normalization, and few-shot sampling, facilitating consistency and fairness. We report on an extensive evaluation of TSFMs across a diverse range of datasets spanning multiple domains and exhibiting varied statistical characteristics. Specifically, we identify pros and cons and inherent limitations of existing TSFMs, and we propose potential directions for new model designs.</p></details> |  |

Despite their effectiveness, most existing methods still adhere to a fast thinking paradigm-relying on extracting historical patterns and mapping them to future values as their core modeling philosophy, lacking an explicit thinking process that incorporates intermediate time series reasoning. Meanwhile, emerging slow-thinking LLMs (e.g., OpenAI-o1) have shown remarkable multi-step reasoning capabilities, offering an alternative way to overcome these issues. However, prompt engineering alone presents several limitations - including high computational cost, privacy risks, and limited capacity for in-depth domain-specific time series reasoning. To address these limitations, a more promising approach is to train LLMs to develop slow thinking capabilities and acquire strong time series reasoning skills. For this purpose, we propose Time-R1, a two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning framework designed to enhance multi-step reasoning ability of LLMs for time series forecasting. Specifically, the first stage conducts supervised fine-tuning for warmup adaptation, while the second stage employs reinforcement learning to improve the model's generalization ability. Particularly, we design a fine-grained multi-objective reward specifically for time series forecasting, and then introduce GRIP (group-based relative importance for policy optimization), which leverages non-uniform sampling to further encourage and optimize the model's exploration of effective reasoning paths. Experiments demonstrate that Time-R1 significantly improves forecast performance across diverse datasets.</p></details> |  |

We propose a two-stage pipeline designed to overcome this limitation. The first stage employs a U-Net based segmentation network, trained on a dataset enriched with overlapping signals and fortified with custom data augmentations, to accurately isolate the primary ECG trace. The subsequent stage converts this refined binary mask into a time-series signal using established digitization techniques, enhanced by an adaptive grid detection module for improved versatility across different ECG formats and scales. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. The U-Net architecture achieves an IoU of 0.87 for the fine-grained segmentation task. Crucially, our proposed digitization method yields superior performance compared to a well-established baseline technique across both non-overlapping and challenging overlapping ECG samples. For non-overlapping signals, our method achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0010 and a Pearson Correlation Coefficient (rho) of 0.9644, compared to 0.0015 and 0.9366, respectively, for the baseline. On samples with signal overlap, our method achieved an MSE of 0.0029 and a rho of 0.9641, significantly improving upon the baseline's 0.0178 and 0.8676. This work demonstrates an effective strategy to significantly enhance digitization accuracy, especially in the presence of signal overlaps, thereby laying a strong foundation for the reliable conversion of analog ECG records into analyzable digital data for contemporary research and clinical applications. The implementation is publicly available at this GitHub repository: https://github.com/masoudrahimi39/ECG-code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-IMM: A Dataset and Benchmark for Irregular Multimodal Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10412v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data in real-world applications such as healthcare, climate modeling, and finance are often irregular, multimodal, and messy, with varying sampling rates, asynchronous modalities, and pervasive missingness. However, existing benchmarks typically assume clean, regularly sampled, unimodal data, creating a significant gap between research and real-world deployment. We introduce Time-IMM, a dataset specifically designed to capture cause-driven irregularity in multimodal multivariate time series. Time-IMM represents nine distinct types of time series irregularity, categorized into trigger-based, constraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. Complementing the dataset, we introduce IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting on irregular multimodal time series, enabling asynchronous integration and realistic evaluation. IMM-TSF includes specialized fusion modules, including a timestamp-to-text fusion module and a multimodality fusion module, which support both recency-aware averaging and attention-based integration strategies.

| **[PromptTSS: A Prompting-Based Approach for Interactive Multi-Granularity Time Series Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11170v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series data, collected across various fields such as manufacturing and wearable technology, exhibit states at multiple levels of granularity, from coarse-grained system behaviors to fine-grained, detailed events. Effectively segmenting and integrating states across these different granularities is crucial for tasks like predictive maintenance and performance optimization. However, existing time series segmentation methods face two key challenges: (1) the inability to handle multiple levels of granularity within a unified model, and (2) limited adaptability to new, evolving patterns in dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we propose PromptTSS, a novel framework for time series segmentation with multi-granularity states. PromptTSS uses a unified model with a prompting mechanism that leverages label and boundary information to guide segmentation, capturing both coarse- and fine-grained patterns while adapting dynamically to unseen patterns. Experiments show PromptTSS improves accuracy by 24.49% in multi-granularity segmentation, 17.88% in single-granularity segmentation, and up to 599.24% in transfer learning, demonstrating its adaptability to hierarchical states and evolving time series dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review.

| **[TimeBridge: Better Diffusion Prior Design with Bridge Models for Time Series Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06672v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series generation is widely used in real-world applications such as simulation, data augmentation, and hypothesis testing. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as the de facto approach to time series generation, enabling diverse synthesis scenarios. However, the fixed standard-Gaussian diffusion prior may be ill-suited for general time series data, such as temporal order and fixed points. In this paper, we propose TimeBridge, a framework that flexibly synthesizes time series data by using diffusion bridges to learn paths between a chosen prior and the data distribution. We then explore several prior designs tailored to time series synthesis. Our framework covers (i) data- and time-dependent priors for unconditional generation and (ii) scale-preserving priors for conditional generation. Experiments show that our framework with data-driven priors outperforms standard diffusion models on time series generation.</p></details> |  |

Despite a recent increase in automated center-fixing methods, only one such method (ARCHER-2) is operational, and its best performance is achieved when using microwave or scatterometer data, which are often unavailable. We develop a deep-learning algorithm called GeoCenter; besides a few scalars in the operational Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecasting System, it relies only on geostationary infrared (IR) satellite imagery, which is available for all TC basins at high frequency (10 min) and low latency (< 10 min) during both day and night. GeoCenter ingests an animation (time series) of IR images, including 9 channels at lag times up to 4 hours. The animation is centered at a "first guess" location, offset from the true TC-center location by 48 km on average and sometimes > 100 km; GeoCenter is tasked with correcting this offset. On an independent testing dataset, GeoCenter achieves a mean/median/RMS (root mean square) error of 26.6/22.2/32.4 km for all systems, 24.7/20.8/30.0 km for tropical systems, and 14.6/12.5/17.3 km for category-2--5 hurricanes. These values are similar to ARCHER-2 errors with microwave or scatterometer data, and better than ARCHER-2 errors when only IR data are available. GeoCenter also performs skillful uncertainty quantification, producing a well calibrated ensemble of 150 TC-center locations. Furthermore, all predictors used by GeoCenter are available in real time, which would make GeoCenter easy to implement operationally every 10 min.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to AMS journal Weather and Forecasting.

| **[VISTA: Vision-Language Inference for Training-Free Stock Time-Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18570v3)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stock price prediction remains a complex and high-stakes task in financial analysis, traditionally addressed using statistical models or, more recently, language models. In this work, we introduce VISTA (Vision-Language Inference for Stock Time-series Analysis), a novel, training-free framework that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for multi-modal stock forecasting. VISTA prompts a VLM with both textual representations of historical stock prices and their corresponding line charts to predict future price values. By combining numerical and visual modalities in a zero-shot setting and using carefully designed chain-of-thought prompts, VISTA captures complementary patterns that unimodal approaches often miss. We benchmark VISTA against standard baselines, including ARIMA and text-only LLM-based prompting methods. Experimental results show that VISTA outperforms these baselines by up to 89.83%, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-modal inference for stock time-series analysis and highlighting the potential of VLMs in financial forecasting tasks without requiring task-specific training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the CVPR 2025 Workshop on Transformers for Vision (T4V): https://sites.google.com/view/t4v-cvpr25/accepted-papers</p></details> |
| **[Mamba time series forecasting with uncertainty quantification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10873v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State space models, such as Mamba, have recently garnered attention in time series forecasting due to their ability to capture sequence patterns. However, in electricity consumption benchmarks, Mamba forecasts exhibit a mean error of approximately 8\%. Similarly, in traffic occupancy benchmarks, the mean error reaches 18\%. This discrepancy leaves us to wonder whether the prediction is simply inaccurate or falls within error given spread in historical data. To address this limitation, we propose a method to quantify the predictive uncertainty of Mamba forecasts. Here, we propose a dual-network framework based on the Mamba architecture for probabilistic forecasting, where one network generates point forecasts while the other estimates predictive uncertainty by modeling variance. We abbreviate our tool, Mamba with probabilistic time series forecasting, as Mamba-ProbTSF and the code for its implementation is available on GitHub (https://github.com/PessoaP/Mamba-ProbTSF). Evaluating this approach on synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets, we find Kullback-Leibler divergence between the learned distributions and the data--which, in the limit of infinite data, should converge to zero if the model correctly captures the underlying probability distribution--reduced to the order of $10^{-3}$ for synthetic data and $10^{-1}$ for real-world benchmark, demonstrating its effectiveness. We find that in both the electricity consumption and traffic occupancy benchmark, the true trajectory stays within the predicted uncertainty interval at the two-sigma level about 95\% of the time. We end with a consideration of potential limitations, adjustments to improve performance, and considerations for applying this framework to processes for purely or largely stochastic dynamics where the stochastic changes accumulate, as observed for example in pure Brownian motion or molecular dynamics trajectories.</p></details> |  |
| **[FinTSBridge: A New Evaluation Suite for Real-world Financial Prediction with Advanced Time Series Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06928v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the growing attention to time series forecasting in recent years, many studies have proposed various solutions to address the challenges encountered in time series prediction, aiming to improve forecasting performance. However, effectively applying these time series forecasting models to the field of financial asset pricing remains a challenging issue. There is still a need for a bridge to connect cutting-edge time series forecasting models with financial asset pricing. To bridge this gap, we have undertaken the following efforts: 1) We constructed three datasets from the financial domain; 2) We selected over ten time series forecasting models from recent studies and validated their performance in financial time series; 3) We developed new metrics, msIC and msIR, in addition to MSE and MAE, to showcase the time series correlation captured by the models; 4) We designed financial-specific tasks for these three datasets and assessed the practical performance and application potential of these forecasting models in important financial problems. We hope the developed new evaluation suite, FinTSBridge, can provide valuable insights into the effectiveness and robustness of advanced forecasting models in finanical domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 Workshop Advances in Financial AI</p></details> |
| **[Towards Foundational Models for Dynamical System Reconstruction: Hierarchical Meta-Learning via Mixture of Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05335v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As foundational models reshape scientific discovery, a bottleneck persists in dynamical system reconstruction (DSR): the ability to learn across system hierarchies. Many meta-learning approaches have been applied successfully to single systems, but falter when confronted with sparse, loosely related datasets requiring multiple hierarchies to be learned. Mixture of Experts (MoE) offers a natural paradigm to address these challenges. Despite their potential, we demonstrate that naive MoEs are inadequate for the nuanced demands of hierarchical DSR, largely due to their gradient descent-based gating update mechanism which leads to slow updates and conflicted routing during training. To overcome this limitation, we introduce MixER: Mixture of Expert Reconstructors, a novel sparse top-1 MoE layer employing a custom gating update algorithm based on $K$-means and least squares. Extensive experiments validate MixER's capabilities, demonstrating efficient training and scalability to systems of up to ten parametric ordinary differential equations. However, our layer underperforms state-of-the-art meta-learners in high-data regimes, particularly when each expert is constrained to process only a fraction of a dataset composed of highly related data points. Further analysis with synthetic and neuroscientific time series suggests that the quality of the contextual representations generated by MixER is closely linked to the presence of hierarchical structure in the data.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 11 figures, 7 tables.

| **[Share Secrets for Privacy: Confidential Forecasting with Vertical Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20761v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vertical federated learning (VFL) is a promising area for time series forecasting in many applications, such as healthcare and manufacturing. Critical challenges to address include data privacy and over-fitting on small and noisy datasets during both training and inference. Additionally, such forecasting models must scale well with the number of parties while ensuring strong convergence and low-tuning complexity. We address these challenges and propose ``Secret-shared Time Series Forecasting with VFL'' (STV), a novel framework with the following key features: i) a privacy-preserving algorithm for forecasting with SARIMAX and autoregressive trees on vertically-partitioned data; ii) decentralised forecasting using secret sharing and multi-party computation; and iii) novel N-party algorithms for matrix multiplication and inverse operations for exact parameter optimization, giving strong convergence with minimal tuning complexity. We evaluate on six representative datasets from public and industry-specific contexts. Results demonstrate that STV's forecasting accuracy is comparable to those of centralized approaches. Our exact optimization outperforms centralized methods, including state-of-the-art diffusion models and long-short-term memory, by 23.81% on forecasting accuracy. We also evaluate scalability by examining the communication costs of exact and iterative optimization to navigate the choice between the two. STV's code and supplementary material is available online: https://github.com/adis98/STV.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 20th International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security (ARES 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Neural Functions for Learning Periodic Signal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09526v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As function approximators, deep neural networks have served as an effective tool to represent various signal types. Recent approaches utilize multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to learn a nonlinear mapping from a coordinate to its corresponding signal, facilitating the learning of continuous neural representations from discrete data points. Despite notable successes in learning diverse signal types, coordinate-based MLPs often face issues of overfitting and limited generalizability beyond the training region, resulting in subpar extrapolation performance. This study addresses scenarios where the underlying true signals exhibit periodic properties, either spatially or temporally. We propose a novel network architecture, which extracts periodic patterns from measurements and leverages this information to represent the signal, thereby enhancing generalization and improving extrapolation performance. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method through comprehensive experiments, including the learning of the periodic solutions for differential equations, and time series imputation (interpolation) and forecasting (extrapolation) on real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Powered CPI Prediction Inference with Online Text Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09516v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is an important yet challenging task in economics, where most existing approaches rely on low-frequency, survey-based data. With the recent advances of large language models (LLMs), there is growing potential to leverage high-frequency online text data for improved CPI prediction, an area still largely unexplored. This paper proposes LLM-CPI, an LLM-based approach for CPI prediction inference incorporating online text time series. We collect a large set of high-frequency online texts from a popularly used Chinese social network site and employ LLMs such as ChatGPT and the trained BERT models to construct continuous inflation labels for posts that are related to inflation. Online text embeddings are extracted via LDA and BERT. We develop a joint time series framework that combines monthly CPI data with LLM-generated daily CPI surrogates. The monthly model employs an ARX structure combining observed CPI data with text embeddings and macroeconomic variables, while the daily model uses a VARX structure built on LLM-generated CPI surrogates and text embeddings. We establish the asymptotic properties of the method and provide two forms of constructed prediction intervals. The finite-sample performance and practical advantages of LLM-CPI are demonstrated through both simulation and real data examples.</p></details> | 73 pages, 13 figures |
