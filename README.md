| **[EMTSF:Extraordinary Mixture of SOTA Models for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23396v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The immense success of the Transformer architecture in Natural Language Processing has led to its adoption in Time Se ries Forecasting (TSF), where superior performance has been shown. However, a recent important paper questioned their effectiveness by demonstrating that a simple single layer linear model outperforms Transformer-based models. This was soon shown to be not as valid, by a better transformer-based model termed PatchTST. More re cently, TimeLLM demonstrated even better results by repurposing a Large Language Model (LLM) for the TSF domain. Again, a follow up paper challenged this by demonstrating that removing the LLM component or replacing it with a basic attention layer in fact yields better performance. One of the challenges in forecasting is the fact that TSF data favors the more recent past, and is sometimes subject to unpredictable events. Based upon these recent insights in TSF, we propose a strong Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework. Our method combines the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models including xLSTM, en hanced Linear, PatchTST, and minGRU, among others. This set of complimentary and diverse models for TSF are integrated in a Trans former based MoE gating network. Our proposed model outperforms all existing TSF models on standard benchmarks, surpassing even the latest approaches based on MoE frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mixing It Up: Exploring Mixer Networks for Irregular Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11816v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting Irregular Multivariate Time Series (IMTS) has recently emerged as a distinct research field, necessitating specialized models to address its unique challenges. While most forecasting literature assumes regularly spaced observations without missing values, many real-world datasets - particularly in healthcare, climate research, and biomechanics - violate these assumptions. Time Series (TS)-mixer models have achieved remarkable success in regular multivariate time series forecasting. However, they remain unexplored for IMTS due to their requirement for complete and evenly spaced observations. To bridge this gap, we introduce IMTS-Mixer, a novel forecasting architecture designed specifically for IMTS. Our approach retains the core principles of TS mixer models while introducing innovative methods to transform IMTS into fixed-size matrix representations, enabling their seamless integration with mixer modules. We evaluate IMTS-Mixer on a benchmark of four real-world datasets from various domains. Our results demonstrate that IMTS-Mixer establishes a new state-of-the-art in forecasting accuracy while also improving computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Interpretable Evaluation Measures for Time Series Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23261v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series segmentation is a fundamental task in analyzing temporal data across various domains, from human activity recognition to energy monitoring. While numerous state-of-the-art methods have been developed to tackle this problem, the evaluation of their performance remains critically limited. Existing measures predominantly focus on change point accuracy or rely on point-based measures such as Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), which fail to capture the quality of the detected segments, ignore the nature of errors, and offer limited interpretability. In this paper, we address these shortcomings by introducing two novel evaluation measures: WARI (Weighted Adjusted Rand Index), that accounts for the position of segmentation errors, and SMS (State Matching Score), a fine-grained measure that identifies and scores four fundamental types of segmentation errors while allowing error-specific weighting. We empirically validate WARI and SMS on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, showing that they not only provide a more accurate assessment of segmentation quality but also uncover insights, such as error provenance and type, that are inaccessible with traditional measures.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlightKooba: A Fast Interpretable FTP Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19885v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flight trajectory prediction (FTP) and similar time series tasks typically require capturing smooth latent dynamics hidden within noisy signals. However, existing deep learning models face significant challenges of high computational cost and insufficient interpretability due to their complex black-box nature. This paper introduces FlightKooba, a novel modeling approach designed to extract such underlying dynamics analytically. Our framework uniquely integrates HiPPO theory, Koopman operator theory, and control theory. By leveraging Legendre polynomial bases, it constructs Koopman operators analytically, thereby avoiding large-scale parameter training. The method's core strengths lie in its exceptional computational efficiency and inherent interpretability. Experiments on multiple public datasets validate our design philosophy: for signals exhibiting strong periodicity or clear physical laws (e.g., in aviation, meteorology, and traffic flow), FlightKooba delivers competitive prediction accuracy while reducing trainable parameters by several orders of magnitude and achieving the fastest training speed. Furthermore, we analyze the model's theoretical boundaries, clarifying its inherent low-pass filtering characteristics that render it unsuitable for sequences dominated by high-frequency noise. In summary, FlightKooba offers a powerful, efficient, and interpretable new alternative for time series analysis, particularly in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Versi...</summary><p>Version 2: Major revision of the manuscript to refine the narrative, clarify the model's theoretical limitations and application scope, and improve overall presentation for journal submission</p></details> |
| **[Factor-guided estimation of large covariance matrix function with conditional functional sparsity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02450v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the fundamental task of estimating covariance matrix functions for high-dimensional functional data/functional time series. We consider two functional factor structures encompassing either functional factors with scalar loadings or scalar factors with functional loadings, and postulate functional sparsity on the covariance of idiosyncratic errors after taking out the common unobserved factors. To facilitate estimation, we rely on the spiked matrix model and its functional generalization, and derive some novel asymptotic identifiability results, based on which we develop DIGIT and FPOET estimators under two functional factor models, respectively. Both estimators involve performing associated eigenanalysis to estimate the covariance of common components, followed by adaptive functional thresholding applied to the residual covariance. We also develop functional information criteria for model selection with theoretical guarantees. The convergence rates of involved estimated quantities are respectively established for DIGIT and FPOET estimators. Numerical studies including extensive simulations and a real data application on functional portfolio allocation are conducted to examine the finite-sample performance of the proposed methodology.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version is the accepted version by Journal of Econometrics and includes the supplementary material of the paper</p></details> |
| **[A time warping model for seasonal data with application to age estimation from narwhal tusks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05843v3)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signals with varying periodicity frequently appear in real-world phenomena, necessitating the development of efficient modelling techniques to map the measured nonlinear timeline to linear time. Here we propose a regression model that allows for a representation of periodic and dynamic patterns observed in time series data. The model incorporates a hidden strictly positive stochastic process that represents the instantaneous frequency, allowing the model to adapt and accurately capture varying time scales. A case study focusing on age estimation of narwhal tusks is presented, where cyclic element signals associated with annual growth layer groups are analyzed. We apply the methodology to data from one such tusk collected in West Greenland and use the fitted model to estimate the age of the narwhal. The proposed method is validated using simulated signals with known cycle counts and practical considerations and modelling challenges are discussed in detail. This research contributes to the field of time series analysis, providing a tool and valuable insights for understanding and modeling complex cyclic patterns in diverse domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Echo State Transformer: Attention Over Finite Memories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02917v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models and their underlying Transformer architecture are remarkably efficient, they do not reflect how our brain processes and learns a diversity of cognitive tasks such as language and working memory. Furthermore, sequential data processing with Transformers encounters a fundamental barrier: quadratic complexity growth with sequence length. Motivated by these limitations, our ambition is to create more efficient models that are less reliant on intensive computations. We introduce Echo State Transformers (EST), a hybrid architecture that elegantly resolves this challenge while demonstrating exceptional performance in classification and detection tasks. EST integrates the Transformer attention mechanisms with principles from Reservoir Computing to create a fixed-size window distributed memory system. Drawing inspiration from Echo State Networks, the most prominent instance of the Reservoir Computing paradigm, our approach leverages reservoirs (random recurrent networks) as a lightweight and efficient memory. Our architecture integrates a new module called ''Working Memory'' based on several reservoirs working in parallel. These reservoirs work as independent working memory units with distinct internal dynamics. A novelty here is that the classical reservoir hyperparameters, controlling the dynamics, are now trained. Thus, the EST dynamically adapts the reservoir memory/non-linearity trade-off. Thanks to these working memory units, EST achieves constant computational complexity at each processing step, effectively breaking the quadratic scaling problem of standard Transformers. We evaluate ESTs on a recent challenging timeseries benchmark: the Time Series Library, which comprises 69 tasks across five categories. Results show that ESTs ranks first overall in two of five categories, outperforming strong state-of-the-art baselines on classification and anomaly detection tasks, while remaining competitive on short-term forecasting. These results position ESTs as a compelling alternative for time-series classification and anomaly detection, and a practical complement to transformer-style models in applications that prioritize robust representations and sensitive event detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[A method for outlier detection based on cluster analysis and visual expert criteria](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23136v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Outlier detection is an important problem occurring in a wide range of areas. Outliers are the outcome of fraudulent behaviour, mechanical faults, human error, or simply natural deviations. Many data mining applications perform outlier detection, often as a preliminary step in order to filter out outliers and build more representative models. In this paper, we propose an outlier detection method based on a clustering process. The aim behind the proposal outlined in this paper is to overcome the specificity of many existing outlier detection techniques that fail to take into account the inherent dispersion of domain objects. The outlier detection method is based on four criteria designed to represent how human beings (experts in each domain) visually identify outliers within a set of objects after analysing the clusters. This has an advantage over other clustering-based outlier detection techniques that are founded on a purely numerical analysis of clusters. Our proposal has been evaluated, with satisfactory results, on data (particularly time series) from two different domains: stabilometry, a branch of medicine studying balance-related functions in human beings and electroencephalography (EEG), a neurological exploration used to diagnose nervous system disorders. To validate the proposed method, we studied method outlier detection and efficiency in terms of runtime. The results of regression analyses confirm that our proposal is useful for detecting outlier data in different domains, with a false positive rate of less than 2% and a reliability greater than 99%.</p></details> |  |
| **[IKNet: Interpretable Stock Price Prediction via Keyword-Guided Integration of News and Technical Indicators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07661v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing influence of unstructured external information, such as news articles, on stock prices has attracted growing attention in financial markets. Despite recent advances, most existing newsbased forecasting models represent all articles using sentiment scores or average embeddings that capture the general tone but fail to provide quantitative, context-aware explanations of the impacts of public sentiment on predictions. To address this limitation, we propose an interpretable keyword-guided network (IKNet), which is an explainable forecasting framework that models the semantic association between individual news keywords and stock price movements. The IKNet identifies salient keywords via FinBERTbased contextual analysis, processes each embedding through a separate nonlinear projection layer, and integrates their representations with the time-series data of technical indicators to forecast next-day closing prices. By applying Shapley Additive Explanations the model generates quantifiable and interpretable attributions for the contribution of each keyword to predictions. Empirical evaluations of S&P 500 data from 2015 to 2024 demonstrate that IKNet outperforms baselines, including recurrent neural networks and transformer models, reducing RMSE by up to 32.9% and improving cumulative returns by 18.5%. Moreover, IKNet enhances transparency by offering contextualized explanations of volatility events driven by public sentiment.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Task-Agnostic Fusion of Time Series and Imagery for Earth Observation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23118v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a task-agnostic framework for multimodal fusion of time series and single timestamp images, enabling cross-modal generation and robust downstream performance. Our approach explores deterministic and learned strategies for time series quantization and then leverages a masked correlation learning objective, aligning discrete image and time series tokens in a unified representation space. Instantiated in the Earth observation domain, the pretrained model generates consistent global temperature profiles from satellite imagery and is validated through counterfactual experiments. Across downstream tasks, our task-agnostic pretraining outperforms task-specific fusion by 6\% in R$^2$ and 2\% in RMSE on average, and exceeds baseline methods by 50\% in R$^2$ and 12\% in RMSE. Finally, we analyze gradient sensitivity across modalities, providing insights into model robustness. Code, data, and weights will be released under a permissive license.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAP4TS: A Multi-Aspect Prompting Framework for Time-Series Forecasting with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23090v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances have investigated the use of pretrained large language models (LLMs) for time-series forecasting by aligning numerical inputs with LLM embedding spaces. However, existing multimodal approaches often overlook the distinct statistical properties and temporal dependencies that are fundamental to time-series data. To bridge this gap, we propose MAP4TS, a novel Multi-Aspect Prompting Framework that explicitly incorporates classical time-series analysis into the prompt design. Our framework introduces four specialized prompt components: a Global Domain Prompt that conveys dataset-level context, a Local Domain Prompt that encodes recent trends and series-specific behaviors, and a pair of Statistical and Temporal Prompts that embed handcrafted insights derived from autocorrelation (ACF), partial autocorrelation (PACF), and Fourier analysis. Multi-Aspect Prompts are combined with raw time-series embeddings and passed through a cross-modality alignment module to produce unified representations, which are then processed by an LLM and projected for final forecasting. Extensive experiments across eight diverse datasets show that MAP4TS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based methods. Our ablation studies further reveal that prompt-aware designs significantly enhance performance stability and that GPT-2 backbones, when paired with structured prompts, outperform larger models like LLaMA in long-term forecasting tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[zkSTAR: A zero knowledge system for time series attack detection enforcing regulatory compliance in critical infrastructure networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23060v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial control systems (ICS) form the operational backbone of critical infrastructure networks (CIN) such as power grids, water supply systems, and gas pipelines. As cyber threats to these systems escalate, regulatory agencies are imposing stricter compliance requirements to ensure system-wide security and reliability. A central challenge, however, is enabling regulators to verify the effectiveness of detection mechanisms without requiring utilities to disclose sensitive operational data. In this paper, we introduce zkSTAR, a cyberattack detection framework that leverages zk-SNARKs to reconcile these requirements and enable provable detection guarantees while preserving data confidentiality. Our approach builds on established residual-based statistical hypothesis testing methods applied to state-space detection models. Specifically, we design a two-pronged zk-SNARK architecture that enforces temporal consistency of the state-space dynamics and statistical consistency of the detection tests, allowing regulators to temporally verify alarm correctness without visibility into utility-level data. We formally analyze the soundness and zero knowledge properties of our framework and validate its practical feasibility through computational experiments on real-world ICS datasets. As a result, our work demonstrates a scalable, privacy-preserving alternative for regulatory compliance for ICS driven critical infrastructure networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[SwiftTS: A Swift Selection Framework for Time Series Pre-trained Models via Multi-task Meta-Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23051v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained models exhibit strong generalization to various downstream tasks. However, given the numerous models available in the model hub, identifying the most suitable one by individually fine-tuning is time-consuming. In this paper, we propose \textbf{SwiftTS}, a swift selection framework for time series pre-trained models. To avoid expensive forward propagation through all candidates, SwiftTS adopts a learning-guided approach that leverages historical dataset-model performance pairs across diverse horizons to predict model performance on unseen datasets. It employs a lightweight dual-encoder architecture that embeds time series and candidate models with rich characteristics, computing patchwise compatibility scores between data and model embeddings for efficient selection. To further enhance the generalization across datasets and horizons, we introduce a horizon-adaptive expert composition module that dynamically adjusts expert weights, and the transferable cross-task learning with cross-dataset and cross-horizon task sampling to enhance out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness. Extensive experiments on 14 downstream datasets and 8 pre-trained models demonstrate that SwiftTS achieves state-of-the-art performance in time series pre-trained model selection.</p></details> | 10 pages,6 figures |
| **[Out-of-Distribution Generalization in Time Series: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13868v3)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series frequently manifest distribution shifts, diverse latent features, and non-stationary learning dynamics, particularly in open and evolving environments. These characteristics pose significant challenges for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. While substantial progress has been made, a systematic synthesis of advancements remains lacking. To address this gap, we present the first comprehensive review of OOD generalization methodologies for time series, organized to delineate the field's evolutionary trajectory and contemporary research landscape. We organize our analysis across three foundational dimensions: data distribution, representation learning, and OOD evaluation. For each dimension, we present several popular algorithms in detail. Furthermore, we highlight key application scenarios, emphasizing their real-world impact. Finally, we identify persistent challenges and propose future research directions. A detailed summary of the methods reviewed for the generalization of OOD in time series can be accessed at https://tsood-generalization.com.</p></details> | Work in Progress |
| **[Weighted compositional functional data analysis for modeling and forecasting life-table death counts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22988v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Age-specific life-table death counts observed over time are examples of densities. Non-negativity and summability are constraints that sometimes require modifications of standard linear statistical methods. The centered log-ratio transformation presents a mapping from a constrained to a less constrained space. With a time series of densities, forecasts are more relevant to the recent data than the data from the distant past. We introduce a weighted compositional functional data analysis for modeling and forecasting life-table death counts. Our extension assigns higher weights to more recent data and provides a modeling scheme easily adapted for constraints. We illustrate our method using age-specific Swedish life-table death counts from 1751 to 2020. Compared to their unweighted counterparts, the weighted compositional data analytic method improves short-term point and interval forecast accuracies. The improved forecast accuracy could help actuaries improve the pricing of annuities and setting of reserves.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 10 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[Not All Data are Good Labels: On the Self-supervised Labeling for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14704v3)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Forecasting (TSF) is a crucial task in various domains, yet existing TSF models rely heavily on high-quality data and insufficiently exploit all available data. This paper explores a novel self-supervised approach to re-label time series datasets by inherently constructing candidate datasets. During the optimization of a simple reconstruction network, intermediates are used as pseudo labels in a self-supervised paradigm, improving generalization for any predictor. We introduce the Self-Correction with Adaptive Mask (SCAM), which discards overfitted components and selectively replaces them with pseudo labels generated from reconstructions. Additionally, we incorporate Spectral Norm Regularization (SNR) to further suppress overfitting from a loss landscape perspective. Our experiments on eleven real-world datasets demonstrate that SCAM consistently improves the performance of various backbone models. This work offers a new perspective on constructing datasets and enhancing the generalization of TSF models through self-supervised learning. The code is available at https://github.com/SuDIS-ZJU/SCAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS'25 (spotlight)</p></details> |
| **[Diffuse to Detect: A Generalizable Framework for Anomaly Detection with Diffusion Models Applications to UAVs and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22928v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in complex, high-dimensional data, such as UAV sensor readings, is essential for operational safety but challenging for existing methods due to their limited sensitivity, scalability, and inability to capture intricate dependencies. We propose the Diffuse to Detect (DTD) framework, a novel approach that innovatively adapts diffusion models for anomaly detection, diverging from their conventional use in generative tasks with high inference time. By comparison, DTD employs a single-step diffusion process to predict noise patterns, enabling rapid and precise identification of anomalies without reconstruction errors. This approach is grounded in robust theoretical foundations that link noise prediction to the data distribution's score function, ensuring reliable deviation detection. By integrating Graph Neural Networks to model sensor relationships as dynamic graphs, DTD effectively captures spatial (inter-sensor) and temporal anomalies. Its two-branch architecture, with parametric neural network-based energy scoring for scalability and nonparametric statistical methods for interpretability, provides flexible trade-offs between computational efficiency and transparency. Extensive evaluations on UAV sensor data, multivariate time series, and images demonstrate DTD's superior performance over existing methods, underscoring its generality across diverse data modalities. This versatility, combined with its adaptability, positions DTD as a transformative solution for safety-critical applications, including industrial monitoring and beyond.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unifying regression-based and design-based causal inference in time-series experiments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22864v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series experiments, also called switchback experiments or N-of-1 trials, play increasingly important roles in modern applications in medical and industrial areas. Under the potential outcomes framework, recent research has studied time-series experiments from the design-based perspective, relying solely on the randomness in the design to drive the statistical inference. Focusing on simpler statistical methods, we examine the design-based properties of regression-based methods for estimating treatment effects in time-series experiments. We demonstrate that the treatment effects of interest can be consistently estimated using ordinary least squares with an appropriately specified working model and transformed regressors. Our analysis allows for estimating a diverging number of treatment effects simultaneously, and establishes the consistency and asymptotic normality of the regression-based estimators. Additionally, we show that asymptotically, the heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent variance estimators provide conservative estimates of the true, design-based variances. Importantly, although our approach relies on regression, our design-based framework allows for misspecification of the regression model.</p></details> | 53 pages |
| **[Efficiently Learning Synthetic Control Models for High-dimensional Disaggregated Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22828v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Synthetic Control method (SC) has become a valuable tool for estimating causal effects. Originally designed for single-treated unit scenarios, it has recently found applications in high-dimensional disaggregated settings with multiple treated units. However, challenges in practical implementation and computational efficiency arise in such scenarios. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel approach that integrates the Multivariate Square-root Lasso method into the synthetic control framework. We rigorously establish the estimation error bounds for fitting the Synthetic Control weights using Multivariate Square-root Lasso, accommodating high-dimensionality and time series dependencies. Additionally, we quantify the estimation error for the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT). Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that our method offers superior computational efficiency without compromising estimation accuracy. We apply our method to assess the causal impact of COVID-19 Stay-at-Home Orders on the monthly unemployment rate in the United States at the county level.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Theory of the Mechanics of Information: Generalization Through Measurement of Uncertainty (Learning is Measuring)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22809v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional machine learning relies on explicit models and domain assumptions, limiting flexibility and interpretability. We introduce a model-free framework using surprisal (information theoretic uncertainty) to directly analyze and perform inferences from raw data, eliminating distribution modeling, reducing bias, and enabling efficient updates including direct edits and deletion of training data. By quantifying relevance through uncertainty, the approach enables generalizable inference across tasks including generative inference, causal discovery, anomaly detection, and time series forecasting. It emphasizes traceability, interpretability, and data-driven decision making, offering a unified, human-understandable framework for machine learning, and achieves at or near state-of-the-art performance across most common machine learning tasks. The mathematical foundations create a ``physics'' of information, which enable these techniques to apply effectively to a wide variety of complex data types, including missing data. Empirical results indicate that this may be a viable alternative path to neural networks with regard to scalable machine learning and artificial intelligence that can maintain human understandability of the underlying mechanics.</p></details> | 117 pages |
| **[DQS: A Low-Budget Query Strategy for Enhancing Unsupervised Data-driven Anomaly Detection Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05663v3)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Truly unsupervised approaches for time series anomaly detection are rare in the literature. Those that exist suffer from a poorly set threshold, which hampers detection performance, while others, despite claiming to be unsupervised, need to be calibrated using a labelled data subset, which is often not available in the real world. This work integrates active learning with an existing unsupervised anomaly detection method by selectively querying the labels of multivariate time series, which are then used to refine the threshold selection process. To achieve this, we introduce a novel query strategy called the dissimilarity-based query strategy (DQS). DQS aims to maximise the diversity of queried samples by evaluating the similarity between anomaly scores using dynamic time warping. We assess the detection performance of DQS in comparison to other query strategies and explore the impact of mislabelling, a topic that is underexplored in the literature. Our findings indicate that DQS performs best in small-budget scenarios, though the others appear to be more robust when faced with mislabelling. Therefore, in the real world, the choice of query strategy depends on the expertise of the oracle and the number of samples they are willing to label. Regardless, all query strategies outperform the unsupervised threshold even in the presence of mislabelling. Thus, whenever it is feasible to query an oracle, employing an active learning-based threshold is recommended.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Journal of Big Data</p></details> |
| **[FARS: Factor Augmented Regression Scenarios in R](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10679v4)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of macroeconomic/financial time series, the FARS package provides a comprehensive framework in R for the construction of conditional densities of the variable of interest based on the factor-augmented quantile regressions (FA-QRs) methodology, with the factors extracted from multi-level dynamic factor models (ML-DFMs) with potential overlapping group-specific factors. Furthermore, the package also allows the construction of measures of risk as well as modeling and designing economic scenarios based on the conditional densities. In particular, the package enables users to: (i) extract global and group-specific factors using a flexible multi-level factor structure; (ii) compute asymptotically valid confidence regions for the estimated factors, accounting for uncertainty in the factor loadings; (iii) obtain estimates of the parameters of the FA-QRs together with their standard deviations; (iv) recover full predictive conditional densities from estimated quantiles; (v) obtain risk measures based on extreme quantiles of the conditional densities; and (vi) estimate the conditional density and the corresponding extreme quantiles when the factors are stressed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structure-preserving contrastive learning for spatial time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06380v5)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The effectiveness of neural network models largely relies on learning meaningful latent patterns from data, where self-supervised learning of informative representations can enhance model performance and generalisability. However, self-supervised representation learning for spatially characterised time series, which are ubiquitous in transportation domain, poses unique challenges due to the necessity of maintaining fine-grained spatio-temporal similarities in the latent space. In this study, we introduce two structure-preserving regularisers for the contrastive learning of spatial time series: one regulariser preserves the topology of similarities between instances, and the other preserves the graph geometry of similarities across spatial and temporal dimensions. To balance the contrastive learning objective and the need for structure preservation, we propose a dynamic weighting mechanism that adaptively manages this trade-off and stabilises training. We validate the proposed method through extensive experiments, including multivariate time series classification to demonstrate its general applicability, as well as macroscopic and microscopic traffic prediction to highlight its particular usefulness in encoding traffic interactions. Across all tasks, our method preserves the similarity structures more effectively and improves state-of-the-art task performances. This method can be integrated with an arbitrary neural network model and is particularly beneficial for time series data with spatial or geographical features. Furthermore, our findings suggest that well-preserved similarity structures in the latent space indicate more informative and useful representations. This provides insights to design more effective neural networks for data-driven transportation research. Our code is made openly accessible with all resulting data at https://github.com/yiru-jiao/spclt</p></details> | <details><summary>TL;DR...</summary><p>TL;DR: Preserving certain structures of similarity relations in spatio-temporal data can improve downstream task performance via contrastive learning</p></details> |
| **[Atlas Urban Index: A VLM-Based Approach for Spatially and Temporally Calibrated Urban Development Monitoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22702v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the {\em Atlas Urban Index} (AUI), a metric for measuring urban development computed using Sentinel-2 \citep{spoto2012sentinel2} satellite imagery. Existing approaches, such as the {\em Normalized Difference Built-up Index} (NDBI), often struggle to accurately capture urban development due to factors like atmospheric noise, seasonal variation, and cloud cover. These limitations hinder large-scale monitoring of human development and urbanization. To address these challenges, we propose an approach that leverages {\em Vision-Language Models }(VLMs) to provide a development score for regions. Specifically, we collect a time series of Sentinel-2 images for each region. Then, we further process the images within fixed time windows to get an image with minimal cloud cover, which serves as the representative image for that time window. To ensure consistent scoring, we adopt two strategies: (i) providing the VLM with a curated set of reference images representing different levels of urbanization, and (ii) supplying the most recent past image to both anchor temporal consistency and mitigate cloud-related noise in the current image. Together, these components enable AUI to overcome the challenges of traditional urbanization indices and produce more reliable and stable development scores. Our qualitative experiments on Bangalore suggest that AUI outperforms standard indices such as NDBI.</p></details> | <details><summary>An ab...</summary><p>An abridged version of this paper will be presented at and appear in the Proceedings of ACM IKDD CODS 2025</p></details> |
| **[TABL-ABM: A Hybrid Framework for Synthetic LOB Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22685v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent application of deep learning models to financial trading has heightened the need for high fidelity financial time series data. This synthetic data can be used to supplement historical data to train large trading models. The state-of-the-art models for the generative application often rely on huge amounts of historical data and large, complicated models. These models range from autoregressive and diffusion-based models through to architecturally simpler models such as the temporal-attention bilinear layer. Agent-based approaches to modelling limit order book dynamics can also recreate trading activity through mechanistic models of trader behaviours. In this work, we demonstrate how a popular agent-based framework for simulating intraday trading activity, the Chiarella model, can be combined with one of the most performant deep learning models for forecasting multi-variate time series, the TABL model. This forecasting model is coupled to a simulation of a matching engine with a novel method for simulating deleted order flow. Our simulator gives us the ability to test the generative abilities of the forecasting model using stylised facts. Our results show that this methodology generates realistic price dynamics however, when analysing deeper, parts of the markets microstructure are not accurately recreated, highlighting the necessity for including more sophisticated agent behaviors into the modeling framework to help account for tail events.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, accepted to the Workshop on AI in Finance at ECAI2025</p></details> |
| **[Inference on common trends in functional time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00590v5)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study statistical inference on unit roots and cointegration for time series in a Hilbert space. We develop statistical inference on the number of common stochastic trends embedded in the time series, i.e., the dimension of the nonstationary subspace. We also consider tests of hypotheses on the nonstationary and stationary subspaces themselves. The Hilbert space can be of an arbitrarily large dimension, and our methods remain asymptotically valid even when the time series of interest takes values in a subspace of possibly unknown dimension. This has wide applicability in practice; for example, to cointegrated vector time series that are either high-dimensional or of finite dimension, to high-dimensional factor models that include a finite number of nonstationary factors, to cointegrated curve-valued (or function-valued) time series, and to nonstationary dynamic functional factor models. We include two empirical illustrations to the term structure of interest rates and labor market indices, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Without Augmenting: Unsupervised Time Series Representation Learning via Frame Projections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22655v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning representations without labeled data. Most SSL approaches rely on strong, well-established, handcrafted data augmentations to generate diverse views for representation learning. However, designing such augmentations requires domain-specific knowledge and implicitly imposes representational invariances on the model, which can limit generalization. In this work, we propose an unsupervised representation learning method that replaces augmentations by generating views using orthonormal bases and overcomplete frames. We show that embeddings learned from orthonormal and overcomplete spaces reside on distinct manifolds, shaped by the geometric biases introduced by representing samples in different spaces. By jointly leveraging the complementary geometry of these distinct manifolds, our approach achieves superior performance without artificially increasing data diversity through strong augmentations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on nine datasets across five temporal sequence tasks, where signal-specific characteristics make data augmentations particularly challenging. Without relying on augmentation-induced diversity, our method achieves performance gains of up to 15--20\% over existing self-supervised approaches.

| **[CLEANet: Robust and Efficient Anomaly Detection in Contaminated Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22619v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series (MTS) anomaly detection is essential for maintaining the reliability of industrial systems, yet real-world deployment is hindered by two critical challenges: training data contamination (noises and hidden anomalies) and inefficient model inference. Existing unsupervised methods assume clean training data, but contamination distorts learned patterns and degrades detection accuracy. Meanwhile, complex deep models often overfit to contamination and suffer from high latency, limiting practical use. To address these challenges, we propose CLEANet, a robust and efficient anomaly detection framework in contaminated multivariate time series. CLEANet introduces a Contamination-Resilient Training Framework (CRTF) that mitigates the impact of corrupted samples through an adaptive reconstruction weighting strategy combined with clustering-guided contrastive learning, thereby enhancing robustness. To further avoid overfitting on contaminated data and improve computational efficiency, we design a lightweight conjugate MLP that disentangles temporal and cross-feature dependencies. Across five public datasets, CLEANet achieves up to 73.04% higher F1 and 81.28% lower runtime compared with ten state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, integrating CRTF into three advanced models yields an average 5.35% F1 gain, confirming its strong generalizability.</p></details> |  |

Focusing on Subject 07-Brownie, the study investigates the entire processing pipeline, from data alignment and transformation to fusion method evaluation, interpretability, and modality contribution. A unified preprocessing pipeline is developed to temporally align heterogeneous video and audio data. Fusion is performed through resampling, grayscale conversion, segmentation, and feature standardization. Semantic richness is confirmed via heatmaps, spectrograms, and luminance time series, while frame-aligned waveform overlays demonstrate temporal consistency. Results indicate that late fusion yields the highest validation accuracy, followed by hybrid fusion, with early fusion performing the lowest. To assess the interpretability and discriminative power of audio and video in fused activity recognition, PCA and t-SNE visualize feature coherence over time. Classification results show limited performance for audio alone, moderate for video, and significant improvement with multimodal fusion, underscoring the strengths of combined data. Incorporating RFID data, which captures sparse interactions asynchronously, further enhances recognition accuracy by over 50% and improves macro-averaged ROC-AUC. The framework demonstrates the potential to transform raw, asynchronous sensor data into aligned, semantically meaningful representations, providing a reproducible approach for multimodal data integration and interpretation in intelligent systems designed to perceive complex human activities.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[NetBurst: Event-Centric Forecasting of Bursty, Intermittent Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22397v1)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting on widely used benchmark time series data (e.g., ETT, Electricity, Taxi, and Exchange Rate, etc.) has favored smooth, seasonal series, but network telemetry time series -- traffic measurements at service, IP, or subnet granularity -- are instead highly bursty and intermittent, with heavy-tailed bursts and highly variable inactive periods. These properties place the latter in the statistical regimes made famous and popularized more than 20 years ago by B.~Mandelbrot. Yet forecasting such time series with modern-day AI architectures remains underexplored. We introduce NetBurst, an event-centric framework that reformulates forecasting as predicting when bursts occur and how large they are, using quantile-based codebooks and dual autoregressors. Across large-scale sets of production network telemetry time series and compared to strong baselines, such as Chronos, NetBurst reduces Mean Average Scaled Error (MASE) by 13--605x on service-level time series while preserving burstiness and producing embeddings that cluster 5x more cleanly than Chronos. In effect, our work highlights the benefits that modern AI can reap from leveraging Mandelbrot's pioneering studies for forecasting in bursty, intermittent, and heavy-tailed regimes, where its operational value for high-stakes decision making is of paramount interest.</p></details> |  |
| **[Monitoring State Transitions in Markovian Systems with Sampling Cost](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22327v1)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider a node-monitor pair, where the node's state varies with time. The monitor needs to track the node's state at all times; however, there is a fixed cost for each state query. So the monitor may instead predict the state using time-series forecasting methods, including time-series foundation models (TSFMs), and query only when prediction uncertainty is high. Since query decisions influence prediction accuracy, determining when to query is nontrivial. A natural approach is a greedy policy that predicts when the expected prediction loss is below the query cost and queries otherwise. We analyze this policy in a Markovian setting, where the optimal (OPT) strategy is a state-dependent threshold policy minimizing the time-averaged sum of query cost and prediction losses. We show that, in general, the greedy policy is suboptimal and can have an unbounded competitive ratio, but under common conditions such as identically distributed transition probabilities, it performs close to OPT. For the case of unknown transition probabilities, we further propose a projected stochastic gradient descent (PSGD)-based learning variant of the greedy policy, which achieves a favorable predict-query tradeoff with improved computational efficiency compared to OPT.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |
| **[TimeXL: Explainable Multi-modal Time Series Prediction with LLM-in-the-Loop](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01013v3)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis provides essential insights for real-world system dynamics and informs downstream decision-making, yet most existing methods often overlook the rich contextual signals present in auxiliary modalities. To bridge this gap, we introduce TimeXL, a multi-modal prediction framework that integrates a prototype-based time series encoder with three collaborating Large Language Models (LLMs) to deliver more accurate predictions and interpretable explanations. First, a multi-modal prototype-based encoder processes both time series and textual inputs to generate preliminary forecasts alongside case-based rationales. These outputs then feed into a prediction LLM, which refines the forecasts by reasoning over the encoder's predictions and explanations. Next, a reflection LLM compares the predicted values against the ground truth, identifying textual inconsistencies or noise. Guided by this feedback, a refinement LLM iteratively enhances text quality and triggers encoder retraining. This closed-loop workflow-prediction, critique (reflect), and refinement-continuously boosts the framework's performance and interpretability. Empirical evaluations on four real-world datasets demonstrate that TimeXL achieves up to 8.9% improvement in AUC and produces human-centric, multi-modal explanations, highlighting the power of LLM-driven reasoning for time series prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Lightweight Gradient-based Causal Discovery Framework with Applications to Complex Industrial Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11178v2)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advancement of deep learning technologies, various neural network-based Granger causality models have been proposed. Although these models have demonstrated notable improvements, several limitations remain. Most existing approaches adopt the component-wise architecture, necessitating the construction of a separate model for each time series, which results in substantial computational costs. In addition, imposing the sparsity-inducing penalty on the first-layer weights of the neural network to extract causal relationships weakens the model's ability to capture complex interactions. To address these limitations, we propose Gradient Regularization-based Neural Granger Causality (GRNGC), which requires only one time series prediction model and applies $L_{1}$ regularization to the gradient between model's input and output to infer Granger causality. Moreover, GRNGC is not tied to a specific time series forecasting model and can be implemented with diverse architectures such as KAN, MLP, and LSTM, offering enhanced flexibility. Numerical simulations on DREAM, Lorenz-96, fMRI BOLD, and CausalTime show that GRNGC outperforms existing baselines and significantly reduces computational overhead. Meanwhile, experiments on real-world DNA, Yeast, HeLa, and bladder urothelial carcinoma datasets further validate the model's effectiveness in reconstructing gene regulatory networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,3 figures, conference</p></details> |
| **[Learning Satellite Pattern-of-Life Identification: A Diffusion-based Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10814v3)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Earth's orbital satellite population grows exponentially, effective space situational awareness becomes critical for collision prevention and sustainable operations. Current approaches to monitor satellite behaviors rely on expert knowledge and rule-based systems that scale poorly. Among essential monitoring tasks, satellite pattern-of-life (PoL) identification, analyzing behaviors like station-keeping maneuvers and drift operations, remains underdeveloped due to aerospace system complexity, operational variability, and inconsistent ephemerides sources. We propose a novel generative approach for satellite PoL identification that significantly eliminates the dependence on expert knowledge. The proposed approach leverages orbital elements and positional data to enable automatic pattern discovery directly from observations. Our implementation uses a diffusion model framework for end-to-end identification without manual refinement or domain expertise. The architecture combines a multivariate time-series encoder to capture hidden representations of satellite positional data with a conditional denoising process to generate accurate PoL classifications. Through experiments across diverse real-world satellite operational scenarios, our approach demonstrates superior identification quality and robustness across varying data quality characteristics. A case study using actual satellite data confirms the approach's transformative potential for operational behavior pattern identification, enhanced tracking, and space situational awareness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dopamine-driven synaptic credit assignment in neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22178v1)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solving the synaptic Credit Assignment Problem(CAP) is central to learning in both biological and artificial neural systems. Finding an optimal solution for synaptic CAP means setting the synaptic weights that assign credit to each neuron for influencing the final output and behavior of neural networks or animals. Gradient-based methods solve this problem in artificial neural networks using back-propagation, however, not in the most efficient way. For instance, back-propagation requires a chain of top-down gradient computations. This leads to an expensive optimization process in terms of computing power and memory linked with well-known weight transport and update locking problems. To address these shortcomings, we take a NeuroAI approach and draw inspiration from neural Reinforcement Learning to develop a derivative-free optimizer for training neural networks, Dopamine. Dopamine is developed for Weight Perturbation (WP) learning that exploits stochastic updating of weights towards optima. It achieves this by minimizing the regret, a form of Reward Prediction Error (RPE) between the expected outcome from the perturbed model and the actual outcome from the unperturbed model. We use this RPE to adjust the learning rate in the network (i.e., creating an adaptive learning rate strategy, similar to the role of dopamine in the brain). We tested the Dopamine optimizer for training multi-layered perceptrons for XOR tasks, and recurrent neural networks for chaotic time series forecasting. Dopamine-trained models demonstrate accelerated convergence and outperform standard WP, and give comparable performance to gradient-based algorithms, while consuming significantly less computation and memory. Overall, the Dopamine optimizer not only finds robust solutions and comparable performance to the state-of-the-art Machine Learning optimizers but is also neurobiologically more plausible.</p></details> |  |
| **[ShapeX: Shapelet-Driven Post Hoc Explanations for Time Series Classification Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20084v2)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explaining time series classification models is crucial, particularly in high-stakes applications such as healthcare and finance, where transparency and trust play a critical role. Although numerous time series classification methods have identified key subsequences, known as shapelets, as core features for achieving state-of-the-art performance and validating their pivotal role in classification outcomes, existing post-hoc time series explanation (PHTSE) methods primarily focus on timestep-level feature attribution. These explanation methods overlook the fundamental prior that classification outcomes are predominantly driven by key shapelets. To bridge this gap, we present ShapeX, an innovative framework that segments time series into meaningful shapelet-driven segments and employs Shapley values to assess their saliency. At the core of ShapeX lies the Shapelet Describe-and-Detect (SDD) framework, which effectively learns a diverse set of shapelets essential for classification. We further demonstrate that ShapeX produces explanations which reveal causal relationships instead of just correlations, owing to the atomicity properties of shapelets. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that ShapeX outperforms existing methods in identifying the most relevant subsequences, enhancing both the precision and causal fidelity of time series explanations.</p></details> |  |

While real-world data involves multiple interacting semantic factors over time, prior work has mostly focused on simpler two-factor static and dynamic settings, primarily because such settings make data collection easier, thereby overlooking the inherently multi-factor nature of real-world data. We introduce the first standardized benchmark for evaluating multi-factor sequential disentanglement across six diverse datasets spanning video, audio, and time series. Our benchmark includes modular tools for dataset integration, model development, and evaluation metrics tailored to multi-factor analysis. We additionally propose a post-hoc Latent Exploration Stage to automatically align latent dimensions with semantic factors, and introduce a Koopman-inspired model that achieves state-of-the-art results. Moreover, we show that Vision-Language Models can automate dataset annotation and serve as zero-shot disentanglement evaluators, removing the need for manual labels and human intervention. Together, these contributions provide a robust and scalable foundation for advancing multi-factor sequential disentanglement. Our code is available on GitHub, and the datasets and trained models are available on Hugging Face.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for the Thirty-ninth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems Datasets and Benchmarks Track</p></details> |

We characterize the behavior of affine time-invariant systems via kernel, input-output, state-space, and finite-horizon data-driven representations, demonstrating a range of structural parallels with linear time-invariant systems. Building on these representations, we introduce a new persistence of excitation condition tailored to the model class of affine time-invariant systems. The condition yields a new fundamental lemma that parallels the classical result for linear systems while provably reducing data requirements. Our analysis highlights that excitation conditions must be adapted to the model class: overlooking structural differences may lead to unnecessarily conservative data requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control</p></details> |

Forecasting the probability distribution of peak demand on shorter timescales is a critical forward-facing issue under increasing volatility. This study introduces a novel ensemble-based machine learning method for peak demand probability density forecasting that extends classical extreme value theory to model time series peaks as nonstationary statistical distributions. The approach employs an ensemble of tree-based learners that recursively partition the covariate space and estimate local generalized extreme value distributions, allowing it to automatically capture complex covariate-dependent parameter variations. Unlike existing approaches, which often suffer from convergence issues or restrictive functional forms, this framework is both flexible and robust. Validation on a case study based on the PJM interconnection demonstrates that the method achieves a 38 percent reduction in committed capacity when generation is scheduled based on a reliability criterion. These improvements provide practical value for power system operation, enabling risk-aware capacity scheduling under peak demand uncertainty and supporting reliability-driven decision making in future energy systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Compl...</summary><p>Completed major revision</p></details> |
| **[TRACE: Grounding Time Series in Context for Multimodal Embedding and Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09114v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ubiquity of dynamic data in domains such as weather, healthcare, and energy underscores a growing need for effective interpretation and retrieval of time-series data. These data are inherently tied to domain-specific contexts, such as clinical notes or weather narratives, making cross-modal retrieval essential not only for downstream tasks but also for developing robust time-series foundation models by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite the increasing demand, time-series retrieval remains largely underexplored. Existing methods often lack semantic grounding, struggle to align heterogeneous modalities, and have limited capacity for handling multi-channel signals. To address this gap, we propose TRACE, a generic multimodal retriever that grounds time-series embeddings in aligned textual context. TRACE enables fine-grained channel-level alignment and employs hard negative mining to facilitate semantically meaningful retrieval. It supports flexible cross-modal retrieval modes, including Text-to-Timeseries and Timeseries-to-Text, effectively linking linguistic descriptions with complex temporal patterns. By retrieving semantically relevant pairs, TRACE enriches downstream models with informative context, leading to improved predictive accuracy and interpretability. Beyond a static retrieval engine, TRACE also serves as a powerful standalone encoder, with lightweight task-specific tuning that refines context-aware representations while maintaining strong cross-modal alignment. These representations achieve state-of-the-art performance on downstream forecasting and classification tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple domains highlight its dual utility, as both an effective encoder for downstream applications and a general-purpose retriever to enhance time-series models.</p></details> |  |

It has demonstrated significant performance improvements over existing benchmarks. In this work, we introduce the Quantum Temporal Fusion Transformer (QTFT), a quantum-enhanced hybrid quantum-classical architecture that extends the capabilities of the classical TFT framework. The core idea of this work is inspired by the foundation studies, \textit{The Power of Quantum Neural Networks} by Amira Abbas \textit{et al.} and \textit{Quantum Vision Transformers} by El Amine Cherrat \textit{et al.}, published in \textit{ Nature Computational Science} (2021) and \textit{Quantum} (2024), respectively. A key advantage of our approach lies in its foundation on a variational quantum algorithm, enabling implementation on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices without strict requirements on the number of qubits or circuit depth. Our results demonstrate that QTFT is successfully trained on the forecasting datasets and is capable of accurately predicting future values. In particular, our experimental results on two different datasets display that the model outperforms its classical counterpart in terms of both training and test loss. These results indicate the prospect of using quantum computing to boost deep learning architectures in complex machine learning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discrete Fourier Transform versus Discrete Chi-Square Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01540v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We compare two time series analysis methods, the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and our Discrete Chi-square Method (DCM). DCM is designed for detecting many signals superimposed on an unknown trend. The solution for the non-linear DCM model is an ill-posed problem. The backbone of DCM is the Gauss-Markov theorem that the least squares fit is the best unbiased estimator for linear regression models. DCM is a simple numerical time series analysis method that performs a massive number of linear least squares fits. Hence, the data spacing, even or uneven, is irrelevant. We show that our numerical solution for the DCM model fulfils the three conditions of a well-posed problem: existence, uniqueness and stability.The Fisher-test is used to identify the best DCM model from all alternative tested DCM models. The correct DCM model must also pass our Predictivity-test. Our analyses of seven different simulated data samples expose the weaknesses of DFT and the efficiency of DCM. The DCM signal and trend detection depend only on the sample size and the accuracy of data. DCM is an ideal forecasting method because the time span of observations is irrelevant. If the Gauss-Markov theorem is valid, DCM can not fail. We recommend fast sampling of large high quality datasets and the analysis of those datasets using numerical DCM parallel computation Python code.</p></details> | 26 pages, 8 figures |

We study out-of-distribution (OOD) detection for RL time series and introduce DEEDEE, a two-statistic detector that revisits representation-heavy pipelines with a minimal alternative. DEEDEE uses only an episodewise mean and an RBF kernel similarity to a training summary, capturing complementary global and local deviations. Despite its simplicity, DEEDEE matches or surpasses contemporary detectors across standard RL OOD suites, delivering a 600-fold reduction in compute (FLOPs / wall-time) and an average 5% absolute accuracy gain over strong baselines. Conceptually, our results indicate that diverse anomaly types often imprint on RL trajectories through a small set of low-order statistics, suggesting a compact foundation for OOD detection in complex environments.</p></details> |  |

DS reconstruction (DSR) seeks to infer generative surrogate models of these from observed data, reproducing their long-term behavior. Existing DSR approaches require purpose-training for any new system observed, lacking the zero-shot and in-context inference capabilities known from LLMs. Here we introduce DynaMix, a novel multivariate ALRNN-based mixture-of-experts architecture pre-trained for DSR, the first DSR model able to generalize zero-shot to out-of-domain DS. Just from a provided context signal, without any re-training, DynaMix faithfully forecasts the long-term evolution of novel DS where existing time series (TS) foundation models, like Chronos, fail -- at a fraction of the number of parameters (0.1%) and orders of magnitude faster inference times. DynaMix outperforms TS foundation models in terms of long-term statistics, and often also short-term forecasts, even on real-world time series, like traffic or weather data, typically used for training and evaluating TS models, but not at all part of DynaMix' training corpus. We illustrate some of the failure modes of TS models for DSR problems, and conclude that models built on DS principles may bear a huge potential also for advancing the TS prediction field.</p></details> |  |

However, practitioners often resort to ad-hoc, non-standardized scripts, as common metrics are often unsuitable for specialized, structured outputs (e.g., automated plans, time-series) or holistic comparison across modalities (e.g., text, audio, and image). This fragmentation hinders comparability and slows AI system development. To address this challenge, we present GAICo (Generative AI Comparator): a deployed, open-source Python library that streamlines and standardizes GenAI output comparison. GAICo provides a unified, extensible framework supporting a comprehensive suite of reference-based metrics for unstructured text, specialized structured data formats, and multimedia (images, audio). Its architecture features a high-level API for rapid, end-to-end analysis, from multi-model comparison to visualization and reporting, alongside direct metric access for granular control. We demonstrate GAICo's utility through a detailed case study evaluating and debugging complex, multi-modal AI Travel Assistant pipelines. GAICo empowers AI researchers and developers to efficiently assess system performance, make evaluation reproducible, improve development velocity, and ultimately build more trustworthy AI systems, aligning with the goal of moving faster and safer in AI deployment.

Forecasts help government agencies properly prepare and distribute resources related to opioid overdoses. Our approach uses county and district level aggregations of suspected opioid overdose encounters and forecasts future counts for different time intervals. Models with different levels of complexity were evaluated to minimize forecasting error. A variety of additional covariates relevant to opioid overdoses and public health were tested to determine their impact on model performance. Our evaluation shows that useful predictions can be generated with limited error for different types of regions, and high performance can be achieved using commonly available covariates and relatively simple forecasting models.</p></details> |  |

The framework encompasses existing architectures, such as input-dependent block-diagonal linear recurrent neural networks and DeltaNet's diagonal-plus-low-rank structure, as well as two novel variants based on sparsity and the Walsh-Hadamard transform. We prove that, unlike the diagonal state-transition matrices of S4D and Mamba, SLiCEs employing block-diagonal, sparse, or Walsh-Hadamard matrices match the maximal expressivity of dense matrices. Empirically, SLiCEs solve the $A_5$ state-tracking benchmark with a single layer, achieve best-in-class length generalisation on regular language tasks among parallel-in-time models, and match the performance of log neural controlled differential equations on six multivariate time-series classification datasets while cutting the average time per training step by a factor of twenty.</p></details> | 32 pages, 5 figures |

The SB framework formulates time series synthesis as an entropic optimal interpolation transport problem between a reference probability measure on path space and a target joint distribution. This results in a stochastic differential equation over a finite horizon that accurately captures the temporal dynamics of the target time series. While the SB approach has been largely explored in fields like image generation, there is a scarcity of studies for its application to time series. In this work, we bridge this gap by conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the SB method's robustness and generative performance. We benchmark it against state-of-the-art (SOTA) time series generation methods across diverse datasets, assessing its strengths, limitations, and capacity to model complex temporal dependencies. Our results offer valuable insights into the SB framework's potential as a versatile and robust tool for time series generation.</p></details> | 9 pages |

This research introduces a novel methodology for time series forecasting that combines Ensemble technique with a Direct Multi-Step (DMS) forecasting procedure. This Ensembled Direct Multi-Step (EDMS) approach not only leverages the strengths of both techniques but also capitalizes on their synergy. The ensemble models in the methodology were selected based on performance, complexity, and computational resource requirements, encompassing a full spectrum of model complexities, from simple Linear and Polynomial Regression to medium-complexity ETS and complex LSTM model. Models were weighted based on their performances. In the DMS procedure we limit retraining to one- and five- year/month forecasts for economic and financial data respectively. Standard Iterative Multi-Step (IMS) procedure is employed for other horizons, effectively reducing computational demands while maintaining satisfactory results. The proposed methodology is benchmarked against Ensemble technique conventionally applied to IMS-generated forecasts, utilizing several publicly available macroeconomic and financial datasets. Results demonstrate a significant performance improvement with EDMS methodology, averaging a 33.32% enhancement across the analysed datasets, and sometimes improvement reaching above 60%.</p></details> | 39 pages, 7 figures |

However, existing estimation methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality, require restrictive distributional assumptions, or need exponentially large datasets for reliable convergence. We address these limitations in the literature by proposing TENDE (Transfer Entropy Neural Diffusion Estimation), a novel approach that leverages score-based diffusion models to estimate transfer entropy through conditional mutual information. By learning score functions of the relevant conditional distributions, TENDE provides flexible, scalable estimation while making minimal assumptions about the underlying data-generating process. We demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness compared to existing neural estimators and other state-of-the-art approaches across synthetic benchmarks and real data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Forecast reconciliation with non-linear constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21249v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Methods for forecasting time series adhering to linear constraints have seen notable development in recent years, especially with the advent of forecast reconciliation. This paper extends forecast reconciliation to the open question of non-linearly constrained time series. Non-linear constraints can emerge with variables that are formed as ratios such as mortality rates and unemployment rates. On the methodological side, Non-linearly Constrained Reconciliation (NLCR) is proposed. This algorithm adjusts forecasts that fail to meet non-linear constraints, in a way that ensures the new forecasts meet the constraints. The NLCR method is a projection onto a non-linear surface, formulated as a constrained optimisation problem. On the theoretical side, optimisation methods are again used, this time to derive sufficient conditions for when the NLCR methodology is guaranteed to improve forecast accuracy. Finally on the empirical side, NLCR is applied to two datasets from demography and economics and shown to significantly improve forecast accuracy relative to relevant benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding Token-level Topological Structures in Transformer-based Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10337v4)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in time series forecasting (TSF) by capturing positional and semantic topological relationships among input tokens. However, it remains unclear whether existing Transformers fully leverage the intrinsic topological structure among tokens throughout intermediate layers. Through empirical and theoretical analyses, we identify that current Transformer architectures progressively degrade the original positional and semantic topology of input tokens as the network deepens, thus limiting forecasting accuracy. Furthermore, our theoretical results demonstrate that explicitly enforcing preservation of these topological structures within intermediate layers can tighten generalization bounds, leading to improved forecasting performance. Motivated by these insights, we propose the Topology Enhancement Method (TEM), a novel Transformer-based TSF method that explicitly and adaptively preserves token-level topology. TEM consists of two core modules: 1) the Positional Topology Enhancement Module (PTEM), which injects learnable positional constraints to explicitly retain original positional topology; 2) the Semantic Topology Enhancement Module (STEM), which incorporates a learnable similarity matrix to preserve original semantic topology. To determine optimal injection weights adaptively, TEM employs a bi-level optimization strategy. The proposed TEM is a plug-and-play method that can be integrated with existing Transformer-based TSF methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that integrating TEM with a variety of existing methods significantly improves their predictive performance, validating the effectiveness of explicitly preserving original token-level topology. Our code is publicly available at: \href{https://github.com/jlu-phyComputer/TEM}{https://github.com/jlu-phyComputer/TEM}.</p></details> |  |

This paper reformulates a significant challenge in radio astronomy, Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) detection, as a time-series segmentation task suited for SNN execution. Automated systems capable of real-time operation with minimal energy consumption are increasingly important in modern radio telescopes. We explore several spectrogram encoding methods and network parameters, applying first and second-order leaky integrate and fire SNNs to tackle RFI detection. We introduce a divisive normalisation-inspired pre-processing step, improving detection performance across multiple encodings strategies. Our approach achieves competitive performance on a synthetic dataset and compelling initial results on real data from the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR). We position SNNs as a viable path towards real-time RFI detection, with many possibilities for follow-up studies. These findings highlight the potential for SNNs performing complex time-series tasks, paving the way towards efficient, real-time processing in radio astronomy and other data-intensive fields.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 6 figures, 10 tables.

| **[Shylock: Causal Discovery in Multivariate Time Series based on Hybrid Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21181v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal relationship discovery has been drawing increasing attention due to its prevalent application. Existing methods rely on human experience, statistical methods, or graphical criteria methods which are error-prone, stuck at the idealized assumption, and rely on a huge amount of data. And there is also a serious data gap in accessing Multivariate time series(MTS) in many areas, adding difficulty in finding their causal relationship. Existing methods are easy to be over-fitting on them. To fill the gap we mentioned above, in this paper, we propose Shylock, a novel method that can work well in both few-shot and normal MTS to find the causal relationship. Shylock can reduce the number of parameters exponentially by using group dilated convolution and a sharing kernel, but still learn a better representation of variables with time delay. By combing the global constraint and the local constraint, Shylock achieves information sharing among networks to help improve the accuracy. To evaluate the performance of Shylock, we also design a data generation method to generate MTS with time delay. We evaluate it on commonly used benchmarks and generated datasets. Extensive experiments show that Shylock outperforms two existing state-of-art methods on both few-shot and normal MTS. We also developed Tcausal, a library for easy use and deployed it on the EarthDataMiner platform</p></details> |  |
| **[ViTime: Foundation Model for Time Series Forecasting Powered by Vision Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07311v4)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting (TSF) possesses great practical values in various fields, including power and energy, transportation, etc. TSF methods have been studied based on knowledge from classical statistics to modern deep learning. Yet, all of them were developed based on one fundamental concept, the numerical data fitting. Thus, the models developed have long been known to be problem-specific and lacking application generalizability. Practitioners expect a TSF foundation model that serves TSF tasks in different applications. The central question is then how to develop such a TSF foundation model. This paper offers one pioneering study in the TSF foundation model development method and proposes a vision intelligence-powered framework, ViTime, for the first time. ViTime fundamentally shifts TSF from numerical fitting to operations based on a binary image-based time series metric space and naturally supports both point and probabilistic forecasting. We also provide rigorous theoretical analyses of ViTime, including quantization-induced system error bounds and principled strategies for optimal parameter selection. Furthermore, we propose RealTS, an innovative synthesis algorithm generating diverse and realistic training samples, effectively enriching the training data and significantly enhancing model generalizability. Extensive experiments demonstrate ViTime's state-of-the-art performance. In zero-shot scenarios, ViTime outperforms TimesFM by 9-15\%. With just 10\% fine-tuning data, ViTime surpasses both leading foundation models and fully-supervised benchmarks, a gap that widens with 100\% fine-tuning. ViTime also exhibits exceptional robustness, effectively handling missing data and outperforming TimesFM by 20-30\% under various data perturbations, validating the power of its visual space data operation paradigm.</p></details> |  |

As a case study, we focus on four key U.S. macroeconomic indicators -- GDP, economic growth, inflation, and unemployment -- and we apply the LPCMCI framework with Gaussian Process Distance Correlation (GPDC) to uncover dynamic causal relationships in quarterly data from 1970 to 2021. Our results reveal a robust unidirectional causal link from economic growth to GDP and highlight the limited connectivity of inflation, suggesting the influence of latent factors. Unemployment exhibits strong autoregressive dependence, motivating its use as a case study for probabilistic forecasting. Leveraging the Chronos framework, a large language model trained for time series, we perform zero-shot predictions on unemployment. This approach delivers accurate forecasts one and two quarters ahead, without requiring task-specific training. Crucially, the model's uncertainty-aware predictions yield 90\% confidence intervals, enabling effective anomaly detection through statistically principled deviation analysis. This study demonstrates the value of combining causal structure learning with probabilistic language models to inform economic policy and enhance forecasting robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2nd edition of the Workshop in AI and Finance at ECAI-2025</p></details> |
| **[Autocorrelation Test under Frequent Mean Shifts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21047v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Testing for the presence of autocorrelation is a fundamental problem in time series analysis. Classical methods such as the Box-Pierce test rely on the assumption of stationarity, necessitating the removal of non-stationary components such as trends or shifts in the mean prior to application. However, this is not always practical, particularly when the mean structure is complex, such as being piecewise constant with frequent shifts. In this work, we propose a new inferential framework for autocorrelation in time series data under frequent mean shifts. In particular, we introduce a Shift-Immune Portmanteau (SIP) test that reliably tests for autocorrelation and is robust against mean shifts. We illustrate an application of our method to nanopore sequencing data.</p></details> |  |

Yet robust labeling is essential to enable machine learning models for understanding, prediction, and forecasting. We present the \textit{Clustering and Indexation Pipeline with Human Evaluation for Recognition} (CIPHER), a framework designed to accelerate large-scale labeling of complex time series in physics. CIPHER integrates \textit{indexable Symbolic Aggregate approXimation} (iSAX) for interpretable compression and indexing, density-based clustering (HDBSCAN) to group recurring phenomena, and a human-in-the-loop step for efficient expert validation. Representative samples are labeled by domain scientists, and these annotations are propagated across clusters to yield systematic, scalable classifications. We evaluate CIPHER on the task of classifying solar wind phenomena in OMNI data, a central challenge in space weather research, showing that the framework recovers meaningful phenomena such as coronal mass ejections and stream interaction regions. Beyond this case study, CIPHER highlights a general strategy for combining symbolic representations, unsupervised learning, and expert knowledge to address label scarcity in time series across the physical sciences.

| **[Exploring Spiking Neural Networks for Binary Classification in Multivariate Time Series at the Edge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20997v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a general framework for training spiking neural networks (SNNs) to perform binary classification on multivariate time series, with a focus on step-wise prediction and high precision at low false alarm rates. The approach uses the Evolutionary Optimization of Neuromorphic Systems (EONS) algorithm to evolve sparse, stateful SNNs by jointly optimizing their architectures and parameters. Inputs are encoded into spike trains, and predictions are made by thresholding a single output neuron's spike counts. We also incorporate simple voting ensemble methods to improve performance and robustness. To evaluate the framework, we apply it with application-specific optimizations to the task of detecting low signal-to-noise ratio radioactive sources in gamma-ray spectral data. The resulting SNNs, with as few as 49 neurons and 66 synapses, achieve a 51.8% true positive rate (TPR) at a false alarm rate of 1/hr, outperforming PCA (42.7%) and deep learning (49.8%) baselines. A three-model any-vote ensemble increases TPR to 67.1% at the same false alarm rate. Hardware deployment on the microCaspian neuromorphic platform demonstrates 2mW power consumption and 20.2ms inference latency. We also demonstrate generalizability by applying the same framework, without domain-specific modification, to seizure detection in EEG recordings. An ensemble achieves 95% TPR with a 16% false positive rate, comparable to recent deep learning approaches with significant reduction in parameter count.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in 2025 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)</p></details> |
| **[LLM-Integrated Bayesian State Space Models for Multimodal Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20952v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting in the real world requires integrating structured time-series data with unstructured textual information, but existing methods are architecturally limited by fixed input/output horizons and are unable to model or quantify uncertainty. We address this challenge by introducing LLM-integrated Bayesian State space models (LBS), a novel probabilistic framework for multimodal temporal forecasting. At a high level, LBS consists of two components: (1) a state space model (SSM) backbone that captures the temporal dynamics of latent states from which both numerical and textual observations are generated and (2) a pretrained large language model (LLM) that is adapted to encode textual inputs for posterior state estimation and decode textual forecasts consistent with the latent trajectory. This design enables flexible lookback and forecast windows, principled uncertainty quantification, and improved temporal generalization thanks to the well-suited inductive bias of SSMs toward modeling dynamical systems. Experiments on the TextTimeCorpus benchmark demonstrate that LBS improves the previous state-of-the-art by 13.20% while providing human-readable summaries of each forecast. Our work is the first to unify LLMs and SSMs for joint numerical and textual prediction, offering a novel foundation for multimodal temporal reasoning.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Unsupervised Anomaly Prediction with N-BEATS and Graph Neural Network in Multi-variate Semiconductor Process Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20718v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semiconductor manufacturing is an extremely complex and precision-driven process, characterized by thousands of interdependent parameters collected across diverse tools and process steps. Multi-variate time-series analysis has emerged as a critical field for real-time monitoring and fault detection in such environments. However, anomaly prediction in semiconductor fabrication presents several critical challenges, including high dimensionality of sensor data and severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults. Furthermore, the complex interdependencies between variables complicate both anomaly prediction and root-cause-analysis. This paper proposes two novel approaches to advance the field from anomaly detection to anomaly prediction, an essential step toward enabling real-time process correction and proactive fault prevention. The proposed anomaly prediction framework contains two main stages: (a) training a forecasting model on a dataset assumed to contain no anomalies, and (b) performing forecast on unseen time series data. The forecast is compared with the forecast of the trained signal. Deviations beyond a predefined threshold are flagged as anomalies. The two approaches differ in the forecasting model employed. The first assumes independence between variables by utilizing the N-BEATS model for univariate time series forecasting. The second lifts this assumption by utilizing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture inter-variable relationships. Both models demonstrate strong forecasting performance up to a horizon of 20 time points and maintain stable anomaly prediction up to 50 time points. The GNN consistently outperforms the N-BEATS model while requiring significantly fewer trainable parameters and lower computational cost. These results position the GNN as promising solution for online anomaly forecasting to be deployed in manufacturing environments.</p></details> | 17 pages, 27 figures |

To achieve this, M2VN combines open-source market features with news embeddings generated by Time Machine GPT, a recently introduced point-in-time LLM, ensuring temporal integrity. An auxiliary alignment loss is introduced to enhance the integration of structured and unstructured data within the deep learning architecture.

| **[Flow based approach for Dynamic Temporal Causal models with non-Gaussian or Heteroscedastic Noises](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17065v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding causal relationships in multivariate time series is crucial in many scenarios, such as those dealing with financial or neurological data. Many such time series exhibit multiple regimes, i.e., consecutive temporal segments with a priori unknown boundaries, with each regime having its own causal structure. Inferring causal dependencies and regime shifts is critical for analyzing the underlying processes. However, causal structure learning in this setting is challenging due to (1) non-stationarity, i.e., each regime can have its own causal graph and mixing function, and (2) complex noise distributions, which may be nonGaussian or heteroscedastic. Existing causal discovery approaches cannot address these challenges, since generally assume stationarity or Gaussian noise with constant variance. Hence, we introduce FANTOM, a unified framework for causal discovery that handles non-stationary processes along with non-Gaussian and heteroscedastic noises. FANTOM simultaneously infers the number of regimes and their corresponding indices and learns each regime's Directed Acyclic Graph. It uses a Bayesian Expectation Maximization algorithm that maximizes the evidence lower bound of the data log-likelihood. On the theoretical side, we prove, under mild assumptions, that temporal heteroscedastic causal models, introduced in FANTOM's formulation, are identifiable in both stationary and non-stationary settings. In addition, extensive experiments on synthetic and real data show that FANTOM outperforms existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[xTime: Extreme Event Prediction with Hierarchical Knowledge Distillation and Expert Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20651v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extreme events frequently occur in real-world time series and often carry significant practical implications. In domains such as climate and healthcare, these events, such as floods, heatwaves, or acute medical episodes, can lead to serious consequences. Accurate forecasting of such events is therefore of substantial importance. Most existing time series forecasting models are optimized for overall performance within the prediction window, but often struggle to accurately predict extreme events, such as high temperatures or heart rate spikes. The main challenges are data imbalance and the neglect of valuable information contained in intermediate events that precede extreme events. In this paper, we propose xTime, a novel framework for extreme event forecasting in time series. xTime leverages knowledge distillation to transfer information from models trained on lower-rarity events, thereby improving prediction performance on rarer ones. In addition, we introduce a mixture of experts (MoE) mechanism that dynamically selects and fuses outputs from expert models across different rarity levels, which further improves the forecasting performance for extreme events. Experiments on multiple datasets show that xTime achieves consistent improvements, with forecasting accuracy on extreme events improving from 3% to 78%.</p></details> |  |

In this paper we formalize the ground for the MIMOSA (Mining Interpretable Models explOiting Sophisticated Algorithms) framework, a comprehensive methodology for generating predictive models that balance interpretability with performance while embedding key ethical properties. We formally define here the supervised learning setting across diverse decision-making tasks and data types, including tabular data, time series, images, text, transactions, and trajectories. We characterize three major families of interpretable models: feature importance, rule, and instance based models. For each family, we analyze their interpretability dimensions, reasoning mechanisms, and complexity. Beyond interpretability, we formalize three critical ethical properties, namely causality, fairness, and privacy, providing formal definitions, evaluation metrics, and verification procedures for each. We then examine the inherent trade-offs between these properties and discuss how privacy requirements, fairness constraints, and causal reasoning can be embedded within interpretable pipelines. By evaluating ethical measures during model generation, this framework establishes the theoretical foundations for developing AI systems that are not only accurate and interpretable but also fair, privacy-preserving, and causally aware, i.e., trustworthy.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a novel hierarchical neural architecture search approach for time series forecasting tasks. With the design of a hierarchical search space, we incorporate many architecture types designed for forecasting tasks and allow for the efficient combination of different forecasting architecture modules. Results on long-term-time-series-forecasting tasks show that our approach can search for lightweight high-performing forecasting architectures across different forecasting tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-series Random Process Complexity Ranking Using a Bound on Conditional Differential Entropy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20551v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conditional differential entropy provides an intuitive measure for relatively ranking time-series complexity by quantifying uncertainty in future observations given past context. However, its direct computation for high-dimensional processes from unknown distributions is often intractable. This paper builds on the information theoretic prediction error bounds established by Fang et al. \cite{fang2019generic}, which demonstrate that the conditional differential entropy \textbf{$h(X_k \mid X_{k-1},...,X_{k-m})$} is upper bounded by a function of the determinant of the covariance matrix of next-step prediction errors for any next step prediction model. We add to this theoretical framework by further increasing this bound by leveraging Hadamard's inequality and the positive semi-definite property of covariance matrices. To see if these bounds can be used to rank the complexity of time series, we conducted two synthetic experiments: (1) controlled linear autoregressive processes with additive Gaussian noise, where we compare ordinary least squares prediction error entropy proxies to the true entropies of various additive noises, and (2) a complexity ranking task of bio-inspired synthetic audio data with unknown entropy, where neural network prediction errors are used to recover the known complexity ordering. This framework provides a computationally tractable method for time-series complexity ranking using prediction errors from next-step prediction models, that maintains a theoretical foundation in information theory.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

Neural CDEs (NCDEs) treat time series data as observations from a control path, parameterise a CDE's vector field using a neural network, and use the solution path as a continuously evolving hidden state. As their formulation makes them robust to irregular sampling rates, NCDEs are a powerful approach for modelling real-world data. Building on neural rough differential equations (NRDEs), we introduce Log-NCDEs, a novel, effective, and efficient method for training NCDEs. The core component of Log-NCDEs is the Log-ODE method, a tool from the study of rough paths for approximating a CDE's solution. Log-NCDEs are shown to outperform NCDEs, NRDEs, the linear recurrent unit, S5, and MAMBA on a range of multivariate time series datasets with up to $50{,}000$ observations.</p></details> | 23 pages, 5 figures |

Traditional load-balancing strategies are typically reactive and rely on outdated or coarse-grained metrics, often leading to suboptimal routing decisions and increased tail latencies. This paper investigates the use of round-trip time (RTT) predictors to enhance request routing by anticipating application latency. We develop lightweight and accurate RTT predictors that are trained on time-series monitoring data collected from a Kubernetes-managed GPU cluster. By leveraging a reduced set of highly correlated monitoring metrics, our approach maintains low overhead while remaining adaptable to diverse co-location scenarios and heterogeneous hardware. The predictors achieve up to 95% accuracy while keeping the prediction delay within 10% of the application RTT. In addition, we identify the minimum prediction accuracy threshold and key system-level factors required to ensure effective predictor deployment in resource-constrained clusters. Simulation-based evaluation demonstrates that performance-aware load balancing can significantly reduce application RTT and minimize resource waste. These results highlight the feasibility of integrating predictive load balancing into future production systems.</p></details> |  |

However, limited onboard computational resources and data downlink constraints necessitate robust methods for identifying regions of interest in real time. This work presents an adaptive outlier detection algorithm based on the reconstruction error of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature reduction, designed explicitly for space mission applications. The algorithm adapts dynamically to evolving data distributions by using Incremental PCA, enabling deployment without a predefined model for all possible conditions. A pre-scaling process normalizes each feature's magnitude while preserving relative variance within feature types. We demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness in detecting space plasma events, such as distinct space environments, dayside and nightside transients phenomena, and transition layers through NASA's MMS mission observations. Additionally, we apply the method to NASA's THEMIS data, successfully identifying a dayside transient using onboard-available measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCS 2025</p></details> |

However, existing generalist time series foundation models struggle to handle medical time series data due to their inherent challenges, including irregular intervals, heterogeneous sampling rates, and frequent missing values. To address these challenges, we introduce MIRA, a unified foundation model specifically designed for medical time series forecasting. MIRA incorporates a Continuous-Time Rotary Positional Encoding that enables fine-grained modeling of variable time intervals, a frequency-specific mixture-of-experts layer that routes computation across latent frequency regimes to further promote temporal specialization, and a Continuous Dynamics Extrapolation Block based on Neural ODE that models the continuous trajectory of latent states, enabling accurate forecasting at arbitrary target timestamps. Pretrained on a large-scale and diverse medical corpus comprising over 454 billion time points collect from publicly available datasets, MIRA achieves reductions in forecasting errors by an average of 10% and 7% in out-of-distribution and in-distribution scenarios, respectively, when compared to other zero-shot and fine-tuned baselines. We also introduce a comprehensive benchmark spanning multiple downstream clinical tasks, establishing a foundation for future research in medical time series modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical Time Series Forecasting with Robust Reconciliation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20383v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper focuses on forecasting hierarchical time-series data, where each higher-level observation equals the sum of its corresponding lower-level time series. In such contexts, the forecast values should be coherent, meaning that the forecast value of each parent series exactly matches the sum of the forecast values of its child series. Existing hierarchical forecasting methods typically generate base forecasts independently for each series and then apply a reconciliation procedure to adjust them so that the resulting forecast values are coherent across the hierarchy. These methods generally derive an optimal reconciliation, using a covariance matrix of the forecast error. In practice, however, the true covariance matrix is unknown and has to be estimated from finite samples in advance. This gap between the true and estimated covariance matrix may degrade forecast performance. To address this issue, we propose a robust optimization framework for hierarchical reconciliation that accounts for uncertainty in the estimated covariance matrix. We first introduce an uncertainty set for the estimated covariance matrix and formulate a reconciliation problem that minimizes the worst-case expected squared error over this uncertainty set. We show that our problem can be cast as a semidefinite optimization problem. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed robust reconciliation method achieved better forecast performance than existing hierarchical forecasting methods, which indicates the effectiveness of integrating uncertainty into the reconciliation process.</p></details> |  |

Channel-independent methods such as PatchTST excel at temporal modeling but ignore variable correlations, while pure variate-attention approaches such as iTransformer sacrifice temporal encoding. We proposeInvDec (Inverted Decoder), a hybrid architecture that achieves principled separation between temporal encoding and variate-level decoding. InvDec combines a patch-based temporal encoder with an inverted decoder operating on the variate dimension through variate-wise self-attention. We introduce delayed variate embeddings that enrich variable-specific representations only after temporal encoding, preserving temporal feature integrity. An adaptive residual fusion mechanism dynamically balances temporal and variate information across datasets of varying dimensions. Instantiating InvDec with PatchTST yields InvDec-PatchTST. Extensive experiments on seven benchmarks demonstrate significant gains on high-dimensional datasets: 20.9% MSE reduction on Electricity (321 variables), 4.3% improvement on Weather, and 2.7% gain on Traffic compared to PatchTST, while maintaining competitive performance on low-dimensional ETT datasets. Ablation studies validate each component, and analysis reveals that InvDec's advantage grows with dataset dimensionality, confirming that cross-variate modeling becomes critical as the number of variables increases.</p></details> | 23pages, 3 figures |
| **[Conformal Prediction for Time-series Forecasting with Change Points](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02844v3)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conformal prediction has been explored as a general and efficient way to provide uncertainty quantification for time series. However, current methods struggle to handle time series data with change points - sudden shifts in the underlying data-generating process. In this paper, we propose a novel Conformal Prediction for Time-series with Change points (CPTC) algorithm, addressing this gap by integrating a model to predict the underlying state with online conformal prediction to model uncertainties in non-stationary time series. We prove CPTC's validity and improved adaptivity in the time series setting under minimum assumptions, and demonstrate CPTC's practical effectiveness on 6 synthetic and real-world datasets, showing improved validity and adaptivity compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[SynTSBench: Rethinking Temporal Pattern Learning in Deep Learning Models for Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20273v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in deep learning have driven rapid progress in time series forecasting, yet many state-of-the-art models continue to struggle with robust performance in real-world applications, even when they achieve strong results on standard benchmark datasets. This persistent gap can be attributed to the black-box nature of deep learning architectures and the inherent limitations of current evaluation frameworks, which frequently lack the capacity to provide clear, quantitative insights into the specific strengths and weaknesses of different models, thereby complicating the selection of appropriate models for particular forecasting scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a synthetic data-driven evaluation paradigm, SynTSBench, that systematically assesses fundamental modeling capabilities of time series forecasting models through programmable feature configuration. Our framework isolates confounding factors and establishes an interpretable evaluation system with three core analytical dimensions: (1) temporal feature decomposition and capability mapping, which enables systematic evaluation of model capacities to learn specific pattern types; (2) robustness analysis under data irregularities, which quantifies noise tolerance thresholds and anomaly recovery capabilities; and (3) theoretical optimum benchmarking, which establishes performance boundaries for each pattern type-enabling direct comparison between model predictions and mathematical optima. Our experiments show that current deep learning models do not universally approach optimal baselines across all types of temporal features.The code is available at https://github.com/TanQitai/SynTSBench</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[Crisis-Resilient Portfolio Management via Graph-based Spatio-Temporal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20868v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Financial time series forecasting faces a fundamental challenge: predicting optimal asset allocations requires understanding regime-dependent correlation structures that transform during crisis periods. Existing graph-based spatio-temporal learning approaches rely on predetermined graph topologies--correlation thresholds, sector classifications--that fail to adapt when market dynamics shift across different crisis mechanisms: credit contagion, pandemic shocks, or inflation-driven selloffs. We present CRISP (Crisis-Resilient Investment through Spatio-temporal Patterns), a graph-based spatio-temporal learning framework that encodes spatial relationships via Graph Convolutional Networks and temporal dynamics via BiLSTM with self-attention, then learns sparse structures through multi-head Graph Attention Networks. Unlike fixed-topology methods, CRISP discovers which asset relationships matter through attention mechanisms, filtering 92.5% of connections as noise while preserving crisis-relevant dependencies for accurate regime-specific predictions. Trained on 2005--2021 data encompassing credit and pandemic crises, CRISP demonstrates robust generalization to 2022--2024 inflation-driven markets--a fundamentally different regime--by accurately forecasting regime-appropriate correlation structures. This enables adaptive portfolio allocation that maintains profitability during downturns, achieving Sharpe ratio 3.76: 707% improvement over equal-weight baselines and 94% improvement over static graph methods. Learned attention weights provide interpretable regime detection, with defensive cluster attention strengthening 49% during crises versus 31% market-wide--emergent behavior from learning to forecast rather than imposing assumptions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pre-training Epidemic Time Series Forecasters with Compartmental Prototypes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03393v5)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate epidemic forecasting is crucial for outbreak preparedness, but existing data-driven models are often brittle. Typically trained on a single pathogen, they struggle with data scarcity during new outbreaks and fail under distribution shifts caused by viral evolution or interventions. However, decades of surveillance data from diverse diseases offer an untapped source of transferable knowledge. To leverage the collective lessons from history, we propose CAPE, the first open-source pre-trained model for epidemic forecasting. Unlike existing time series foundation models that overlook epidemiological challenges, CAPE models epidemic dynamics as mixtures of latent population states, termed compartmental prototypes. It discovers a flexible dictionary of compartment prototypes directly from surveillance data, enabling each outbreak to be expressed as a time-varying mixture that links observed infections to latent population states. To promote robust generalization, CAPE combines self-supervised pre-training objectives with lightweight epidemic-aware regularizers that align the learned prototypes with epidemiological semantics. On a comprehensive benchmark spanning 17 diseases and 50+ regions, CAPE significantly outperforms strong baselines in zero-shot, few-shot, and full-shot forecasting. This work represents a principled step toward pre-trained epidemic models that are both transferable and epidemiologically grounded.</p></details> | version 2.0_fixed |
| **[AssistedDS: Benchmarking How External Domain Knowledge Assists LLMs in Automated Data Science](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13992v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have advanced the automation of data science workflows. Yet it remains unclear whether they can critically leverage external domain knowledge as human data scientists do in practice. To answer this question, we introduce AssistedDS (Assisted Data Science), a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate how LLMs handle domain knowledge in tabular prediction tasks. AssistedDS features both synthetic datasets with explicitly known generative mechanisms and real-world Kaggle competitions, each accompanied by curated bundles of helpful and adversarial documents. These documents provide domain-specific insights into data cleaning, feature engineering, and model selection. We assess state-of-the-art LLMs on their ability to discern and apply beneficial versus harmful domain knowledge, evaluating submission validity, information recall, and predictive performance. Our results demonstrate three key findings: (1) LLMs frequently exhibit an uncritical adoption of provided information, significantly impairing their predictive performance when adversarial content is introduced, (2) helpful guidance is often insufficient to counteract the negative influence of adversarial information, and (3) in Kaggle datasets, LLMs often make errors in handling time-series data, applying consistent feature engineering across different folds, and interpreting categorical variables correctly. These findings highlight a substantial gap in current models' ability to critically evaluate and leverage expert knowledge, underscoring an essential research direction for developing more robust, knowledge-aware automated data science systems.

| **[DMSC: Dynamic Multi-Scale Coordination Framework for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02753v4)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Forecasting (TSF) faces persistent challenges in modeling intricate temporal dependencies across different scales. Despite recent advances leveraging different decomposition operations and novel architectures based on CNN, MLP or Transformer, existing methods still struggle with static decomposition strategies, fragmented dependency modeling, and inflexible fusion mechanisms, limiting their ability to model intricate temporal dependencies. To explicitly solve the mentioned three problems respectively, we propose a novel Dynamic Multi-Scale Coordination Framework (DMSC) with Multi-Scale Patch Decomposition block (EMPD), Triad Interaction Block (TIB) and Adaptive Scale Routing MoE block (ASR-MoE). Specifically, EMPD is designed as a built-in component to dynamically segment sequences into hierarchical patches with exponentially scaled granularities, eliminating predefined scale constraints through input-adaptive patch adjustment. TIB then jointly models intra-patch, inter-patch, and cross-variable dependencies within each layer's decomposed representations. EMPD and TIB are jointly integrated into layers forming a multi-layer progressive cascade architecture, where coarse-grained representations from earlier layers adaptively guide fine-grained feature extraction in subsequent layers via gated pathways. And ASR-MoE dynamically fuses multi-scale predictions by leveraging specialized global and local experts with temporal-aware weighting. Comprehensive experiments on thirteen real-world benchmarks demonstrate that DMSC consistently maintains state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and superior computational efficiency for TSF tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/1327679995/DMSC.</p></details> |  |
| **[Speculative Sampling for Parametric Temporal Point Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20031v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal point processes are powerful generative models for event sequences that capture complex dependencies in time-series data. They are commonly specified using autoregressive models that learn the distribution of the next event from the previous events. This makes sampling inherently sequential, limiting efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm based on rejection sampling that enables exact sampling of multiple future values from existing TPP models, in parallel, and without requiring any architectural changes or retraining. Besides theoretical guarantees, our method demonstrates empirical speedups on real-world datasets, bridging the gap between expressive modeling and efficient parallel generation for large-scale TPP applications.</p></details> |  |

Key results, such as the law of large numbers and the functional central limit theorem, are known for weakly dependent variables. We demonstrate the transfer of mixing properties from the exogenous regressor to the response via coupling arguments. Additionally, we study Markov chains in random environments with drift and minorization conditions, even under non-stationary environments with favorable mixing properties, and apply this framework to single-server queuing models.</p></details> | 39 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Abstain Mask Retain Core: Time Series Prediction by Adaptive Masking Loss with Representation Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19980v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting plays a pivotal role in critical domains such as energy management and financial markets. Although deep learning-based approaches (e.g., MLP, RNN, Transformer) have achieved remarkable progress, the prevailing "long-sequence information gain hypothesis" exhibits inherent limitations. Through systematic experimentation, this study reveals a counterintuitive phenomenon: appropriately truncating historical data can paradoxically enhance prediction accuracy, indicating that existing models learn substantial redundant features (e.g., noise or irrelevant fluctuations) during training, thereby compromising effective signal extraction. Building upon information bottleneck theory, we propose an innovative solution termed Adaptive Masking Loss with Representation Consistency (AMRC), which features two core components: 1) Dynamic masking loss, which adaptively identified highly discriminative temporal segments to guide gradient descent during model training; 2) Representation consistency constraint, which stabilized the mapping relationships among inputs, labels, and predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that AMRC effectively suppresses redundant feature learning while significantly improving model performance. This work not only challenges conventional assumptions in temporal modeling but also provides novel theoretical insights and methodological breakthroughs for developing efficient and robust forecasting models.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 4 figures.

To bridge this gap, we introduce QoQ-Med-7B/32B, the first open generalist clinical foundation model that jointly reasons across medical images, time-series signals, and text reports. QoQ-Med is trained with Domain-aware Relative Policy Optimization (DRPO), a novel reinforcement-learning objective that hierarchically scales normalized rewards according to domain rarity and modality difficulty, mitigating performance imbalance caused by skewed clinical data distributions. Trained on 2.61 million instruction tuning pairs spanning 9 clinical domains, we show that DRPO training boosts diagnostic performance by 43% in macro-F1 on average across all visual domains as compared to other critic-free training methods like GRPO. Furthermore, with QoQ-Med trained on intensive segmentation data, it is able to highlight salient regions related to the diagnosis, with an IoU 10x higher than open models while reaching the performance of OpenAI o4-mini. To foster reproducibility and downstream research, we release (i) the full model weights, (ii) the modular training pipeline, and (iii) all intermediate reasoning traces at https://github.com/DDVD233/QoQ_Med.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as Oral at NeurIPS 2025.

| **[Phase-driven Domain Generalizable Learning for Nonstationary Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05960v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pattern recognition is a fundamental task in continuous sensing applications, but real-world scenarios often experience distribution shifts that necessitate learning generalizable representations for such tasks. This challenge is exacerbated with time-series data, which also exhibit inherent nonstationarity--variations in statistical and spectral properties over time. In this work, we offer a fresh perspective on learning generalizable representations for time-series classification by considering the phase information of a signal as an approximate proxy for nonstationarity and propose a phase-driven generalizable representation learning framework for time-series classification, PhASER. It consists of three key elements: 1) Hilbert transform-based augmentation, which diversifies nonstationarity while preserving task-specific discriminatory semantics, 2) separate magnitude-phase encoding, viewing time-varying magnitude and phase as independent modalities, and 3) phase-residual feature broadcasting, integrating 2D phase features with a residual connection to the 1D signal representation, providing inherent regularization to improve distribution-invariant learning. Extensive evaluations on five datasets from sleep-stage classification, human activity recognition, and gesture recognition against 13 state-of-the-art baseline methods demonstrate that PhASER consistently outperforms the best baselines by an average of 5% and up to 11% in some cases. Additionally, the principles of PhASER can be broadly applied to enhance the generalizability of existing time-series representation learning models.</p></details> | TMLR 2025 |
| **[Enabling Granular Subgroup Level Model Evaluations by Generating Synthetic Medical Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19728v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel framework for leveraging synthetic ICU time-series data not only to train but also to rigorously and trustworthily evaluate predictive models, both at the population level and within fine-grained demographic subgroups. Building on prior diffusion and VAE-based generators (TimeDiff, HealthGen, TimeAutoDiff), we introduce \textit{Enhanced TimeAutoDiff}, which augments the latent diffusion objective with distribution-alignment penalties. We extensively benchmark all models on MIMIC-III and eICU, on 24-hour mortality and binary length-of-stay tasks. Our results show that Enhanced TimeAutoDiff reduces the gap between real-on-synthetic and real-on-real evaluation (``TRTS gap'') by over 70\%, achieving $\Delta_{TRTS} \leq 0.014$ AUROC, while preserving training utility ($\Delta_{TSTR} \approx 0.01$). Crucially, for 32 intersectional subgroups, large synthetic cohorts cut subgroup-level AUROC estimation error by up to 50\% relative to small real test sets, and outperform them in 72--84\% of subgroups. This work provides a practical, privacy-preserving roadmap for trustworthy, granular model evaluation in critical care, enabling robust and reliable performance analysis across diverse patient populations without exposing sensitive EHR data, contributing to the overall trustworthiness of Medical AI.</p></details> |  |
