| **[State of Health Estimation of Batteries Using a Time-Informed Dynamic Sequence-Inverted Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18320v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid adoption of battery-powered vehicles and energy storage systems over the past decade has made battery health monitoring increasingly critical. Batteries play a central role in the efficiency and safety of these systems, yet they inevitably degrade over time due to repeated charge-discharge cycles. This degradation leads to reduced energy efficiency and potential overheating, posing significant safety concerns. Accurate estimation of a State of Health (SoH) of battery is therefore essential for ensuring operational reliability and safety. Several machine learning architectures, such as LSTMs, transformers, and encoder-based models, have been proposed to estimate SoH from discharge cycle data. However, these models struggle with the irregularities inherent in real-world measurements: discharge readings are often recorded at non-uniform intervals, and the lengths of discharge cycles vary significantly. To address this, most existing approaches extract features from the sequences rather than processing them in full, which introduces information loss and compromises accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel architecture: Time-Informed Dynamic Sequence Inverted Transformer (TIDSIT). TIDSIT incorporates continuous time embeddings to effectively represent irregularly sampled data and utilizes padded sequences with temporal attention mechanisms to manage variable-length inputs without discarding sequence information. Experimental results on the NASA battery degradation dataset show that TIDSIT significantly outperforms existing models, achieving over 50% reduction in prediction error and maintaining an SoH prediction error below 0.58%. Furthermore, the architecture is generalizable and holds promise for broader applications in health monitoring tasks involving irregular time-series data.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |
| **[DisMS-TS: Eliminating Redundant Multi-Scale Features for Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04600v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world time series typically exhibit complex temporal variations, making the time series classification task notably challenging. Recent advancements have demonstrated the potential of multi-scale analysis approaches, which provide an effective solution for capturing these complex temporal patterns. However, existing multi-scale analysis-based time series prediction methods fail to eliminate redundant scale-shared features across multi-scale time series, resulting in the model over- or under-focusing on scale-shared features. To address this issue, we propose a novel end-to-end Disentangled Multi-Scale framework for Time Series classification (DisMS-TS). The core idea of DisMS-TS is to eliminate redundant shared features in multi-scale time series, thereby improving prediction performance. Specifically, we propose a temporal disentanglement module to capture scale-shared and scale-specific temporal representations, respectively. Subsequently, to effectively learn both scale-shared and scale-specific temporal representations, we introduce two regularization terms that ensure the consistency of scale-shared representations and the disparity of scale-specific representations across all temporal scales. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets validate the superiority of DisMS-TS over its competitive baselines, with the accuracy improvement up to 9.71%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for presentation at the ACM International Conference on Multimedia (ACM MM 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Why Do Class-Dependent Evaluation Effects Occur with Time Series Feature Attributions? A Synthetic Data Investigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11790v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating feature attribution methods represents a critical challenge in explainable AI (XAI), as researchers typically rely on perturbation-based metrics when ground truth is unavailable. However, recent work reveals that these evaluation metrics can show different performance across predicted classes within the same dataset. These "class-dependent evaluation effects" raise questions about whether perturbation analysis reliably measures attribution quality, with direct implications for XAI method development and evaluation trustworthiness. We investigate under which conditions these class-dependent effects arise by conducting controlled experiments with synthetic time series data where ground truth feature locations are known. We systematically vary feature types and class contrasts across binary classification tasks, then compare perturbation-based degradation scores with ground truth-based precision-recall metrics using multiple attribution methods. Our experiments demonstrate that class-dependent effects emerge with both evaluation approaches, even in simple scenarios with temporally localized features, triggered by basic variations in feature amplitude or temporal extent between classes. Most critically, we find that perturbation-based and ground truth metrics frequently yield contradictory assessments of attribution quality across classes, with weak correlations between evaluation approaches. These findings suggest that researchers should interpret perturbation-based metrics with care, as they may not always align with whether attributions correctly identify discriminating features. By showing this disconnect, our work points toward reconsidering what attribution evaluation actually measures and developing more rigorous evaluation methods that capture multiple dimensions of attribution quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at TempXAI Workshop @ ECML-PKDD 2025 (Explainable AI for Time Series and Data Streams)</p></details> |
| **[Cloud gap-filling with deep learning for improved grassland monitoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09554v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uninterrupted optical image time series are crucial for the timely monitoring of agricultural land changes, particularly in grasslands. However, the continuity of such time series is often disrupted by clouds. In response to this challenge, we propose an innovative deep learning method that integrates cloud-free optical (Sentinel-2) observations and weather-independent (Sentinel-1) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. Our approach employs a hybrid architecture combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to generate continuous Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series, highlighting the role of NDVI in the synergy between SAR and optical data. We demonstrate the significance of observation continuity by assessing the impact of the generated NDVI time series on the downstream task of grassland mowing event detection. We conducted our study in Lithuania, a country characterized by extensive cloud coverage, and compared our approach with alternative interpolation techniques (i.e., linear, Akima, quadratic). Our method outperformed these techniques, achieving an average Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.024 and a coefficient of determination R^2 of 0.92. Additionally, our analysis revealed improvement in the performance of the mowing event detection, with F1-score up to 84% using two widely applied mowing detection methodologies. Our method also effectively mitigated sudden shifts and noise originating from cloudy observations, which are often missed by conventional cloud masks and adversely affect mowing detection precision.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Computers and Electronics in Agriculture</p></details> |
| **[SDSC:A Structure-Aware Metric for Semantic Signal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14516v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose the Signal Dice Similarity Coefficient (SDSC), a structure-aware metric function for time series self-supervised representation learning. Most Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods for signals commonly adopt distance-based objectives such as mean squared error (MSE), which are sensitive to amplitude, invariant to waveform polarity, and unbounded in scale. These properties hinder semantic alignment and reduce interpretability. SDSC addresses this by quantifying structural agreement between temporal signals based on the intersection of signed amplitudes, derived from the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC).Although SDSC is defined as a structure-aware metric, it can be used as a loss by subtracting from 1 and applying a differentiable approximation of the Heaviside function for gradient-based optimization. A hybrid loss formulation is also proposed to combine SDSC with MSE, improving stability and preserving amplitude where necessary. Experiments on forecasting and classification benchmarks demonstrate that SDSC-based pre-training achieves comparable or improved performance over MSE, particularly in in-domain and low-resource scenarios. The results suggest that structural fidelity in signal representations enhances the semantic representation quality, supporting the consideration of structure-aware metrics as viable alternatives to conventional distance-based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fixing the Pitfalls of Probabilistic Time-Series Forecasting Evaluation by Kernel Quadrature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06079v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the significance of probabilistic time-series forecasting models, their evaluation metrics often involve intractable integrations. The most widely used metric, the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), is a strictly proper scoring function; however, its computation requires approximation. We found that popular CRPS estimators--specifically, the quantile-based estimator implemented in the widely used GluonTS library and the probability-weighted moment approximation--both exhibit inherent estimation biases. These biases lead to crude approximations, resulting in improper rankings of forecasting model performance when CRPS values are close. To address this issue, we introduced a kernel quadrature approach that leverages an unbiased CRPS estimator and employs cubature construction for scalable computation. Empirically, our approach consistently outperforms the two widely used CRPS estimators.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Automated Brake Onset Detection in Naturalistic Driving Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17943v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Response timing measures play a crucial role in the assessment of automated driving systems (ADS) in collision avoidance scenarios, including but not limited to establishing human benchmarks and comparing ADS to human driver response performance. For example, measuring the response time (of a human driver or ADS) to a conflict requires the determination of a stimulus onset and a response onset. In existing studies, response onset relies on manual annotation or vehicle control signals such as accelerator and brake pedal movements. These methods are not applicable when analyzing large scale data where vehicle control signals are not available. This holds in particular for the rapidly expanding sets of ADS log data where the behavior of surrounding road users is observed via onboard sensors. To advance evaluation techniques for ADS and enable measuring response timing when vehicle control signals are not available, we developed a simple and efficient algorithm, based on a piecewise linear acceleration model, to automatically estimate brake onset that can be applied to any type of driving data that includes vehicle longitudinal time series data. We also proposed a manual annotation method to identify brake onset and used it as ground truth for validation. R2 was used as a confidence metric to measure the accuracy of the algorithm, and its classification performance was analyzed using naturalistic collision avoidance data of both ADS and humans, where our method was validated against human manual annotation. Although our algorithm is subject to certain limitations, it is efficient, generalizable, applicable to any road user and scenario types, and is highly configurable.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Recurrent Ensembles for Predicting Brain Responses to Naturalistic Movies (Algonauts 2025)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17897v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting distributed cortical responses to naturalistic stimuli requires models that integrate visual, auditory and semantic information over time. We present a hierarchical multimodal recurrent ensemble that maps pretrained video, audio, and language embeddings to fMRI time series recorded while four subjects watched almost 80 hours of movies provided by the Algonauts 2025 challenge. Modality-specific bidirectional RNNs encode temporal dynamics; their hidden states are fused and passed to a second recurrent layer, and lightweight subject-specific heads output responses for 1000 cortical parcels. Training relies on a composite MSE-correlation loss and a curriculum that gradually shifts emphasis from early sensory to late association regions. Averaging 100 model variants further boosts robustness. The resulting system ranked third on the competition leaderboard, achieving an overall Pearson r = 0.2094 and the highest single-parcel peak score (mean r = 0.63) among all participants, with particularly strong gains for the most challenging subject (Subject 5). The approach establishes a simple, extensible baseline for future multimodal brain-encoding benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2 figures, 1 table.

| **[The Joint Asymptotic Distribution of Entropy and Complexity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17625v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We derive the asymptotic distribution of ordinal-pattern frequencies under weak dependence conditions and investigate the long-run covariance matrix not only analytically for moving-average, Gaussian, and the novel generalized coin-tossing processes, but also approximately by a simulation-based approach. Then, we deduce the asymptotic distribution of the entropy-complexity pair, which emerged as a popular tool for summarizing the time-series dynamics. Here, we make the necessary distinction between a uniform and a non-uniform ordinal pattern distribution and, thus, obtain two different limit theorems. On this basis, we consider a test for serial dependence and check its finite-sample performance. Moreover, we use our asymptotic results to approximate the estimation uncertainty of entropy-complexity pairs.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[A Physically Driven Long Short Term Memory Model for Estimating Snow Water Equivalent over the Continental United States](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20129v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Snow is an essential input for various land surface models. Seasonal snow estimates are available as snow water equivalent (SWE) from process-based reanalysis products or locally from in situ measurements. While the reanalysis products are computationally expensive and available at only fixed spatial and temporal resolutions, the in situ measurements are highly localized and sparse. To address these issues and enable the analysis of the effect of a large suite of physical, morphological, and geological conditions on the presence and amount of snow, we build a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, which is able to estimate the SWE based on time series input of the various physical/meteorological factors as well static spatial/morphological factors. Specifically, this model breaks down the SWE estimation into two separate tasks: (i) a classification task that indicates the presence/absence of snow on a specific day and (ii) a regression task that indicates the height of the SWE on a specific day in the case of snow presence. The model is trained using physical/in situ SWE measurements from the SNOw TELemetry (SNOTEL) snow pillows in the western United States. We will show that trained LSTM models have a classification accuracy of $\geq 93\%$ for the presence of snow and a coefficient of correlation of $\sim 0.9$ concerning their SWE estimates. We will also demonstrate that the models can generalize both spatially and temporally to previously unseen data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint of journal paper in preparation.

| **[CoCAI: Copula-based Conformal Anomaly Identification for Multivariate Time-Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17796v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel framework that harnesses the power of generative artificial intelligence and copula-based modeling to address two critical challenges in multivariate time-series analysis: delivering accurate predictions and enabling robust anomaly detection. Our method, Copula-based Conformal Anomaly Identification for Multivariate Time-Series (CoCAI), leverages a diffusion-based model to capture complex dependencies within the data, enabling high quality forecasting. The model's outputs are further calibrated using a conformal prediction technique, yielding predictive regions which are statistically valid, i.e., cover the true target values with a desired confidence level. Starting from these calibrated forecasts, robust outlier detection is performed by combining dimensionality reduction techniques with copula-based modeling, providing a statistically grounded anomaly score. CoCAI benefits from an offline calibration phase that allows for minimal overhead during deployment and delivers actionable results rooted in established theoretical foundations. Empirical tests conducted on real operational data derived from water distribution and sewerage systems confirm CoCAI's effectiveness in accurately forecasting target sequences of data and in identifying anomalous segments within them.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Presentation at Runtime Verification 25</p></details> |
| **[MIRA: Medical Time Series Foundation Model for Real-World Health Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07584v3)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A unified foundation model for medical time series -- pretrained on open access and ethics board-approved medical corpora -- offers the potential to reduce annotation burdens, minimize model customization, and enable robust transfer across clinical institutions, modalities, and tasks, particularly in data-scarce or privacy-constrained environments. However, existing generalist time series foundation models struggle to handle medical time series data due to their inherent challenges, including irregular intervals, heterogeneous sampling rates, and frequent missing values. To address these challenges, we introduce MIRA, a unified foundation model specifically designed for medical time series forecasting. MIRA incorporates a Continuous-Time Rotary Positional Encoding that enables fine-grained modeling of variable time intervals, a frequency-specific mixture-of-experts layer that routes computation across latent frequency regimes to further promote temporal specialization, and a Continuous Dynamics Extrapolation Block based on Neural ODE that models the continuous trajectory of latent states, enabling accurate forecasting at arbitrary target timestamps. Pretrained on a large-scale and diverse medical corpus comprising over 454 billion time points collect from publicly available datasets, MIRA achieves reductions in forecasting errors by an average of 10% and 7% in out-of-distribution and in-distribution scenarios, respectively, when compared to other zero-shot and fine-tuned baselines. We also introduce a comprehensive benchmark spanning multiple downstream clinical tasks, establishing a foundation for future research in medical time series modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mapping of Weed Management Methods in Orchards using Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19991v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective weed management is crucial for improving agricultural productivity, as weeds compete with crops for vital resources like nutrients and water. Accurate maps of weed management methods are essential for policymakers to assess farmer practices, evaluate impacts on vegetation health, biodiversity, and climate, as well as ensure compliance with policies and subsidies. However, monitoring weed management methods is challenging as they commonly rely on ground-based field surveys, which are often costly, time-consuming and subject to delays. In order to tackle this problem, we leverage earth observation data and Machine Learning (ML). Specifically, we developed separate ML models using Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope satellite time series data, respectively, to classify four distinct weed management methods (Mowing, Tillage, Chemical-spraying, and No practice) in orchards. The findings demonstrate the potential of ML-driven remote sensing to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of weed management mapping in orchards.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for 2025 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[C3RL: Rethinking the Combination of Channel-independence and Channel-mixing from Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17454v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting has drawn increasing attention due to its practical importance. Existing approaches typically adopt either channel-mixing (CM) or channel-independence (CI) strategies. CM strategy can capture inter-variable dependencies but fails to discern variable-specific temporal patterns. CI strategy improves this aspect but fails to fully exploit cross-variable dependencies like CM. Hybrid strategies based on feature fusion offer limited generalization and interpretability. To address these issues, we propose C3RL, a novel representation learning framework that jointly models both CM and CI strategies. Motivated by contrastive learning in computer vision, C3RL treats the inputs of the two strategies as transposed views and builds a siamese network architecture: one strategy serves as the backbone, while the other complements it. By jointly optimizing contrastive and prediction losses with adaptive weighting, C3RL balances representation and forecasting performance. Extensive experiments on seven models show that C3RL boosts the best-case performance rate to 81.4\% for models based on CI strategy and to 76.3\% for models based on CM strategy, demonstrating strong generalization and effectiveness. The code will be available once the paper is accepted.</p></details> |  |
| **[Monitoring digestate application on agricultural crops using Sentinel-2 Satellite imagery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19996v2)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread use of Exogenous Organic Matter in agriculture necessitates monitoring to assess its effects on soil and crop health. This study evaluates optical Sentinel-2 satellite imagery for detecting digestate application, a practice that enhances soil fertility but poses environmental risks like microplastic contamination and nitrogen losses. In the first instance, Sentinel-2 satellite image time series (SITS) analysis of specific indices (EOMI, NDVI, EVI) was used to characterize EOM's spectral behavior after application on the soils of four different crop types in Thessaly, Greece. Furthermore, Machine Learning (ML) models (namely Random Forest, k-NN, Gradient Boosting and a Feed-Forward Neural Network), were used to investigate digestate presence detection, achieving F1-scores up to 0.85. The findings highlight the potential of combining remote sensing and ML for scalable and cost-effective monitoring of EOM applications, supporting precision agriculture and sustainability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for 2025 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS 2025)</p></details> |

We establish the asymptotic null distribution of the proposed test for family-wise error control, and show the consistency of the procedure for multiple change point estimation. Simulation studies and an application to a large dataset of volatilities demonstrate the competitive performance of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[DistrAttention: An Efficient and Flexible Self-Attention Mechanism on Modern GPUs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17245v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Transformer architecture has revolutionized deep learning, delivering the state-of-the-art performance in areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, and time series prediction. However, its core component, self-attention, has the quadratic time complexity relative to input sequence length, which hinders the scalability of Transformers. The exsiting approaches on optimizing self-attention either discard full-contextual information or lack of flexibility. In this work, we design DistrAttention, an effcient and flexible self-attention mechanism with the full context. DistrAttention achieves this by grouping data on the embedding dimensionality, usually referred to as $d$. We realize DistrAttention with a lightweight sampling and fusion method that exploits locality-sensitive hashing to group similar data. A block-wise grouping framework is further designed to limit the errors introduced by locality sensitive hashing. By optimizing the selection of block sizes, DistrAttention could be easily integrated with FlashAttention-2, gaining high-performance on modern GPUs. We evaluate DistrAttention with extensive experiments. The results show that our method is 37% faster than FlashAttention-2 on calculating self-attention. In ViT inference, DistrAttention is the fastest and the most accurate among approximate self-attention mechanisms. In Llama3-1B, DistrAttention still achieves the lowest inference time with only 1% accuray loss.</p></details> |  |
| **[Eco-Friendly AI: Unleashing Data Power for Green Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17241v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) comes with a significant environmental impact, particularly in terms of energy consumption and carbon emissions. This pressing issue highlights the need for innovative solutions to mitigate AI's ecological footprint. One of the key factors influencing the energy consumption of ML model training is the size of the training dataset. ML models are often trained on vast amounts of data continuously generated by sensors and devices distributed across multiple locations. To reduce data transmission costs and enhance privacy, Federated Learning (FL) enables model training without the need to move or share raw data. While FL offers these advantages, it also introduces challenges due to the heterogeneity of data sources (related to volume and quality), computational node capabilities, and environmental impact. This paper contributes to the advancement of Green AI by proposing a data-centric approach to Green Federated Learning. Specifically, we focus on reducing FL's environmental impact by minimizing the volume of training data. Our methodology involves the analysis of the characteristics of federated datasets, the selecting of an optimal subset of data based on quality metrics, and the choice of the federated nodes with the lowest environmental impact. We develop a comprehensive methodology that examines the influence of data-centric factors, such as data quality and volume, on FL training performance and carbon emissions. Building on these insights, we introduce an interactive recommendation system that optimizes FL configurations through data reduction, minimizing environmental impact during training. Applying this methodology to time series classification has demonstrated promising results in reducing the environmental impact of FL tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Interconnections between Corruption and Economic Growth](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08132v3)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores the dynamic relationship between corruption and economic growth through an approach based on a system of stochastic equations. In the context of globalization and economic interdependencies, corruption not only affects investment and distorts markets, but it can also, under certain conditions, temporarily boost economic activity. Using data from the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the Corruption Perception Index (CPI), we implement a time-series-based model to capture the interactions between these two variables. Through a coupled vector autoregressive equations system, our model identifies patterns of interdependence between economic fluctuations and perceptions of corruption at a global level. Employing graph theory and Granger causality, we build a network of interconnections that illustrates how corruption dynamics in one country can influence economic growth and corruption perception in others. The results provide a robust tool for analyzing international political-economic relationships and can serve as a basis for designing policies that promote transparency and sustainable development.</p></details> | <details><summary>We de...</summary><p>We decided to withdraw the current version of the manuscript to improve its structure, clarify some arguments, and incorporate additional results.

| **[The FIX Benchmark: Extracting Features Interpretable to eXperts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13684v4)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature-based methods are commonly used to explain model predictions, but these methods often implicitly assume that interpretable features are readily available. However, this is often not the case for high-dimensional data, and it can be hard even for domain experts to mathematically specify which features are important. Can we instead automatically extract collections or groups of features that are aligned with expert knowledge? To address this gap, we present FIX (Features Interpretable to eXperts), a benchmark for measuring how well a collection of features aligns with expert knowledge. In collaboration with domain experts, we propose FIXScore, a unified expert alignment measure applicable to diverse real-world settings across cosmology, psychology, and medicine domains in vision, language, and time series data modalities. With FIXScore, we find that popular feature-based explanation methods have poor alignment with expert-specified knowledge, highlighting the need for new methods that can better identify features interpretable to experts.</p></details> |  |

This study presents a new frame of LLMs named CGF-LLM using GPT-2 combined with fuzzy time series (FTS) and causal graph to predict multivariate time series, marking the first such architecture in the literature. The key objective is to convert numerical time series into interpretable forms through the parallel application of fuzzification and causal analysis, enabling both semantic understanding and structural insight as input for the pretrained GPT-2 model. The resulting textual representation offers a more interpretable view of the complex dynamics underlying the original time series. The reported results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed LLM-based time series forecasting model, as demonstrated across four different multivariate time series datasets.

| **[Unified Sparse-Matrix Representations for Diverse Neural Architectures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01966v3)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks employ specialized architectures for vision, sequential and language tasks, yet this proliferation obscures their underlying commonalities. We introduce a unified matrix-order framework that casts convolutional, recurrent and self-attention operations as sparse matrix multiplications. Convolution is realized via an upper-triangular weight matrix performing first-order transformations; recurrence emerges from a lower-triangular matrix encoding stepwise updates; attention arises naturally as a third-order tensor factorization. We prove algebraic isomorphism with standard CNN, RNN and Transformer layers under mild assumptions. Empirical evaluations on image classification (MNIST, CIFAR-10/100, Tiny ImageNet), time-series forecasting (ETTh1, Electricity Load Diagrams) and language modeling/classification (AG News, WikiText-2, Penn Treebank) confirm that sparse-matrix formulations match or exceed native model performance while converging in comparable or fewer epochs. By reducing architecture design to sparse pattern selection, our matrix perspective aligns with GPU parallelism and leverages mature algebraic optimization tools. This work establishes a mathematically rigorous substrate for diverse neural architectures and opens avenues for principled, hardware-aware network design.</p></details> |  |

By leveraging techniques from random matrix theory and free probability, we provide sharp asymptotics for the in- and out-of-sample risks of ridge regression when the data points have arbitrary correlations. We demonstrate that in this setting, the generalized cross validation estimator (GCV) fails to correctly predict the out-of-sample risk. However, in the case where the noise residuals have the same correlations as the data points, one can modify the GCV to yield an efficiently-computable unbiased estimator that concentrates in the high-dimensional limit, which we dub CorrGCV. We further extend our asymptotic analysis to the case where the test point has nontrivial correlations with the training set, a setting often encountered in time series forecasting. Assuming knowledge of the correlation structure of the time series, this again yields an extension of the GCV estimator, and sharply characterizes the degree to which such test points yield an overly optimistic prediction of long-time risk. We validate the predictions of our theory across a variety of high dimensional data.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 19 figures. v4: ICML 2025 camera-ready. v5: Fix typo in statement of Theorem 5</p></details> |
| **[Canonical Correlation Patterns for Validating Clustering of Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16497v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clustering of multivariate time series using correlation-based methods reveals regime changes in relationships between variables across health, finance, and industrial applications. However, validating whether discovered clusters represent distinct relationships rather than arbitrary groupings remains a fundamental challenge. Existing clustering validity indices were developed for Euclidean data, and their effectiveness for correlation patterns has not been systematically evaluated. Unlike Euclidean clustering, where geometric shapes provide discrete reference targets, correlations exist in continuous space without equivalent reference patterns. We address this validation gap by introducing canonical correlation patterns as mathematically defined validation targets that discretise the infinite correlation space into finite, interpretable reference patterns. Using synthetic datasets with perfect ground truth across controlled conditions, we demonstrate that canonical patterns provide reliable validation targets, with L1 norm for mapping and L5 norm for silhouette width criterion and Davies-Bouldin index showing superior performance. These methods are robust to distribution shifts and appropriately detect correlation structure degradation, enabling practical implementation guidelines.

| **[Multimodal Forecasting of Sparse Intraoperative Hypotension Events Powered by Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22116v3)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) frequently occurs under general anesthesia and is strongly linked to adverse outcomes such as myocardial injury and increased mortality. Despite its significance, IOH prediction is hindered by event sparsity and the challenge of integrating static and dynamic data across diverse patients. In this paper, we propose \textbf{IOHFuseLM}, a multimodal language model framework. To accurately identify and differentiate sparse hypotensive events, we leverage a two-stage training strategy. The first stage involves domain adaptive pretraining on IOH physiological time series augmented through diffusion methods, thereby enhancing the model sensitivity to patterns associated with hypotension. Subsequently, task fine-tuning is performed on the original clinical dataset to further enhance the ability to distinguish normotensive from hypotensive states. To enable multimodal fusion for each patient, we align structured clinical descriptions with the corresponding physiological time series at the token level. Such alignment enables the model to capture individualized temporal patterns alongside their corresponding clinical semantics. In addition, we convert static patient attributes into structured text to enrich personalized information. Experimental evaluations on two intraoperative datasets demonstrate that IOHFuseLM outperforms established baselines in accurately identifying IOH events, highlighting its applicability in clinical decision support scenarios. Our code is publicly available to promote reproducibility at https://github.com/zjt-gpu/IOHFuseLM.</p></details> |  |

Consequently, the detection and localization of these interference signals are essential to achieve situational awareness, mitigating their impact, and implementing effective counter-measures. Classical Angle of Arrival (AoA) methods exhibit reduced accuracy in multipath environments due to signal reflections and scattering, leading to localization errors. Additionally, AoA-based techniques demand substantial computational resources for array signal processing. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for detecting and classifying interference while estimating the distance, azimuth, and elevation of jamming sources. Our benchmark study evaluates 128 vision encoder and time-series models to identify the highest-performing methods for each task. We introduce an attention-based fusion framework that integrates in-phase and quadrature (IQ) samples with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-computed spectrograms while incorporating 22 AoA features to enhance localization accuracy. Furthermore, we present a novel dataset of moving jamming devices recorded in an indoor environment with dynamic multipath conditions and demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 6 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Density Prediction of Income Distribution Based on Mixed Frequency Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16150v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling large dependent datasets in modern time series analysis is a crucial research area. One effective approach to handle such datasets is to transform the observations into density functions and apply statistical methods for further analysis. Income distribution forecasting, a common application scenario, benefits from predicting density functions as it accounts for uncertainty around point estimates, leading to more informed policy formulation. However, predictive modeling becomes challenging when dealing with mixed-frequency data. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a mixed data sampling regression model for probability density functions (PDF-MIDAS). To mitigate variance inflation caused by high-frequency prediction variables, we utilize exponential Almon polynomials with fewer parameters to regularize the coefficient structure. Additionally, we propose an iterative estimation method based on quadratic programming and the BFGS algorithm. Simulation analyses demonstrate that as the sample size for estimating density functions and observation length increase, the estimator approaches the true value. Real data analysis reveals that compared to single-sequence prediction models, PDF-MIDAS incorporating high-frequency exogenous variables offers a wider range of application scenarios with superior fitting and prediction performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpiroLLM: Finetuning Pretrained LLMs to Understand Spirogram Time Series with Clinical Validation in COPD Reporting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16145v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), a major chronic respiratory disease with persistent airflow limitation, is a leading global cause of disability and mortality. Respiratory spirogram time series, routinely collected during pulmonary function tests (PFTs), play a critical role in the early detection of repsiratory diseases and in monitoring lung function over time. However, most current AI models for COPD diagnosis are limited to outputting classification results without providing a rationale for their diagnostic process, while current Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot understand spirograms yet, which severely limits their clinical trust and adoption. To tackle this challenge, we leverage a cohort of 234,028 individuals from the UK Biobank (UKB) to propose SpiroLLM, the first multimodal large language model that can understand spirogram. The model extracts morphological features from respiratory curves via a SpiroEncoder and aligns them with PFT numerical values in a unified latent space using a SpiroProjector, ultimately empowering a large language model to generate a comprehensive diagnostic report. Experimental results confirm that SpiroLLM achieved a diagnostic AUROC of 0.8980 (95% CI: 0.8820-0.9132). In a robustness test with missing core data, it maintained a 100% valid response rate, far surpassing the 13.4% of a text-only model and showcasing the superiority of its multimodal design. This work demonstrates the substantial potential of deeply fusing physiological signals with large language models, establishing a new paradigm for the next generation of interpretable and reliable clinical decision support tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predictive inference for discrete-valued time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16035v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For discrete-valued time series, predictive inference cannot be implemented through the construction of prediction intervals to some predetermined coverage level, as this is the case for real-valued time series. To address this problem, we propose to reverse the construction principle by considering preselected sets of interest and estimating the probability that a future observation of the process falls into these sets. The accuracy of the prediction is then evaluated by quantifying the uncertainty associated with estimation of these predictive probabilities. We consider parametric and non-parametric approaches and derive asymptotic theory for the estimators involved. Suitable bootstrap approaches to evaluate the distribution of the estimators considered also are introduced. They have the advantage to imitate the distributions of interest under different possible settings, including the practical important case where uncertainty holds true about the correctness of a parametric model used for prediction. Theoretical justification of the bootstrap is given, which also requires investigation of asymptotic properties of parameter estimators under model misspecification. We elaborate on bootstrap implementations under different scenarios and focus on parametric prediction using INAR and INARCH models and (conditional) maximum likelihood estimators. Simulations investigate the finite sample performance of the predictive method developed and applications to real life data sets are presented.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 2 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

Of particular interest are systems that contain implicit relationships between their components, such as conservation laws. Here, we present an Operator Splitting (OS) numerical integration scheme for learning unknown components of DAEs from time-series data. In this work, we show that the proposed OS-based time-stepping scheme is suitable for relevant system-theoretic data-driven modeling tasks. Presented examples include (i) the inverse problem of tank-manifold dynamics and (ii) discrepancy modeling of a network of pumps, tanks, and pipes.

| **[Spectral Differential Network Analysis for High-Dimensional Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07905v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spectral networks derived from multivariate time series data arise in many domains, from brain science to Earth science. Often, it is of interest to study how these networks change under different conditions. For instance, to better understand epilepsy, it would be interesting to capture the changes in the brain connectivity network as a patient experiences a seizure, using electroencephalography data. A common approach relies on estimating the networks in each condition and calculating their difference. Such estimates may behave poorly in high dimensions as the networks themselves may not be sparse in structure while their difference may be. We build upon this observation to develop an estimator of the difference in inverse spectral densities across two conditions. Using an L1 penalty on the difference, consistency is established by only requiring the difference to be sparse. We illustrate the method on synthetic data experiments and on experiments with electroencephalography data.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 13 figures, AISTATS 2025</p></details> |

Various methods have been developed to construct hypergraphs -- referred to as simplicial complexes in the TDA framework -- over datasets, enabling the formation of edges between more than two vertices. This paper addresses the challenge of constructing hypergraphs from collections of multivariate time series. While prior work has focused on the case of a single multivariate time series, we extend this framework to handle collections of such time series. Our approach generalizes the method proposed in Chretien and al. by leveraging the properties of signature transforms to introduce controlled randomness, thereby enhancing the robustness of the construction process. We validate our method on synthetic datasets and present promising results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at GSI25 conference.

Our hypothesis is that this task needs models that are able to learn the data underlying dynamics. We propose to validate it through both systemic and empirical studies. We develop an original $\texttt{PRO-DYN}$ nomenclature to analyze existing models through the lens of dynamics. Two observations thus emerged: $\textbf{1}$. under-performing architectures learn dynamics at most partially, $\textbf{2}$. the location of the dynamics block at the model end is of prime importance. We conduct extensive experiments to confirm our observations on a set of performance-varying models with diverse backbones. Results support the need to incorporate a learnable dynamics block and its use as the final predictor.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Knowledge graphs can contextualize these data, yet current approaches that are applicably to monitoring CPS rely on observation-based approaches. This limits the ability to express computations on sensor data, especially when no assumptions can be made about sampling synchronicity or sampling rates. Methodology: We propose an approach for integrating knowledge graphs with signals that model run-time sensor data as functions from time to data. To demonstrate this approach, we introduce SigSPARQL, a query language that can combine RDF data and signals. We assess its technical feasibility with a prototype and demonstrate its use in a typical CPS monitoring use case. Findings: Our approach enables queries to combine graph-based knowledge with signals, overcoming some key limits of observation-based methods. The developed prototype successfully demonstrated feasibility and applicability. Value: This work presents a query-based approach for CPS monitoring that integrates knowledge graphs and signals, alleviating problems of observation-based approaches. By leveraging system knowledge, it enables operators to run a single query across different system instances within the same domain. Future work will extend SigSPARQL with additional signal functions and evaluate it in large-scale CPS deployments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dictionary-Learning-Based Data Pruning for System Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11484v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>System identification is normally involved in augmenting time series data by time shifting and nonlinearisation (e.g., polynomial basis), both of which introduce redundancy in features and samples. Many research works focus on reducing redundancy feature-wise, while less attention is paid to sample-wise redundancy. This paper proposes a novel data pruning method, called mini-batch FastCan, to reduce sample-wise redundancy based on dictionary learning. Time series data is represented by some representative samples, called atoms, via dictionary learning. The useful samples are selected based on their correlation with the atoms. The method is tested on one simulated dataset and two benchmark datasets. The R-squared between the coefficients of models trained on the full datasets and the coefficients of models trained on pruned datasets is adopted to evaluate the performance of data pruning methods. It is found that the proposed method significantly outperforms the random pruning method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prediction of linear fractional stable motions using codifference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15437v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The linear fractional stable motion (LFSM) extends the fractional Brownian motion (fBm) by considering $\alpha$-stable increments. We propose a method to forecast future increments of the LFSM from past discrete-time observations, using the conditional expectation when $\alpha>1$ or a semimetric projection otherwise. It relies on the codifference, which describes the serial dependence of the process, instead of the covariance. Indeed, covariance is commonly used for predicting an fBm but it is infinite when $\alpha<2$. Some theoretical properties of the method and of its accuracy are studied and both a simulation study and an application to real data confirm the relevance of the approach. The LFSM-based method outperforms the fBm, when forecasting high-frequency FX rates. It also shows a promising performance in the forecast of time series of volatilities, decomposing properly, in the fractal dynamic of rough volatilities, the contribution of the kurtosis of the increments and the contribution of their serial dependence. Moreover, the analysis of hit ratios suggests that, beside independence, persistence, and antipersistence, a fourth regime of serial dependence exists for fractional processes, characterized by a selective memory controlled by a few large increments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Central limit theory for Peaks-over-Threshold partial sums of long memory linear time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20789v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the last 30 years, extensive work has been devoted to developing central limit theory for partial sums of subordinated long memory linear time series. A much less studied problem, motivated by questions that are ubiquitous in extreme value theory, is the asymptotic behavior of such partial sums when the subordination mechanism has a threshold depending on sample size, so as to focus on the right tail of the time series. This article substantially extends longstanding asymptotic techniques by allowing the subordination mechanism to depend on the sample size in this way and to grow at a polynomial rate, while permitting the innovation process to have infinite variance. The cornerstone of our theoretical approach is a tailored $L^r(\mathbf{P})$ reduction principle, which enables the use of classical results on partial sums of long memory linear processes. In this way we obtain asymptotic theory for certain Peaks-over-Threshold estimators with deterministic or random thresholds. Applications comprise both the heavy- and light-tailed regimes -- yielding unexpected results which, to the best of our knowledge, are new to the literature. A simulation study illustrates the relevance of our findings in finite samples.</p></details> | 60 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Log-Euclidean Frameworks for Smooth Brain Connectivity Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15374v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The brain is often studied from a network perspective, where functional activity is assessed using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to estimate connectivity between predefined neuronal regions. Functional connectivity can be represented by correlation matrices computed over time, where each matrix captures the Pearson correlation between the mean fMRI signals of different regions within a sliding window. We introduce several Log-Euclidean Riemannian framework for constructing smooth approximations of functional brain connectivity trajectories. Representing dynamic functional connectivity as time series of full-rank correlation matrices, we leverage recent theoretical Log-Euclidean diffeomorphisms to map these trajectories in practice into Euclidean spaces where polynomial regression becomes feasible. Pulling back the regressed curve ensures that each estimated point remains a valid correlation matrix, enabling a smooth, interpretable, and geometrically consistent approximation of the original brain connectivity dynamics. Experiments on fMRI-derived connectivity trajectories demonstrate the geometric consistency and computational efficiency of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Variational Mode-Driven Graph Convolutional Network for Spatiotemporal Traffic Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16191v3)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper focuses on spatiotemporal (ST) traffic prediction using graph neural networks (GNNs). Given that ST data comprises non-stationary and complex temporal patterns, interpreting and predicting such trends is inherently challenging. Representing ST data in decomposed modes helps infer underlying behavior and assess the impact of noise on predictive performance. We propose a framework that decomposes ST data into interpretable modes using variational mode decomposition (VMD) and processes them through a neural network for future state forecasting. Unlike existing graph-based traffic forecasters that operate directly on raw or aggregated time series, the proposed hybrid approach, termed the Variational Mode Graph Convolutional Network (VMGCN), first decomposes non-stationary signals into interpretable variational modes by determining the optimal mode count via reconstruction-loss minimization and then learns both intramode and cross-mode spatiotemporal dependencies through a novel attention-augmented GCN. Additionally, we analyze the significance of each mode and the effect of bandwidth constraints on multi-horizon traffic flow predictions. The proposed two-stage design yields significant accuracy gains while providing frequency-level interpretability with demonstrated superior performance on the LargeST dataset for both short-term and long-term forecasting tasks. The implementation is publicly available on https://github.com/OsamaAhmad369/VMGCN.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM T...</summary><p>ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST) Submission, 2025</p></details> |

For example, Preferential Subspace Identification (PSID) builds a state-space model of a primary time-series (e.g., neural activity) to optimally predict a secondary time-series (e.g., behavior). However, PSID focuses on optimal prediction using past primary data, even though in offline applications, better estimation can be achieved by incorporating concurrent data (filtering) or all available data (smoothing). Here, we extend PSID to enable optimal filtering and smoothing. First, we show that the presence of a secondary signal makes it possible to uniquely identify a model with an optimal Kalman update step (to enable filtering) from a family of otherwise equivalent state-space models. Our filtering solution augments PSID with a reduced-rank regression step that directly learns the optimal gain required for the update step from data. We refer to this extension of PSID as PSID with filtering. Second, inspired by two-filter Kalman smoother formulations, we develop a novel forward-backward PSID smoothing algorithm where we first apply PSID with filtering and then apply it again in the reverse time direction on the residuals of the filtered secondary signal. We validate our methods on simulated data, showing that our approach recovers the ground-truth model parameters for filtering, and achieves optimal filtering and smoothing decoding performance of the secondary signal that matches the ideal performance of the true underlying model. This work provides a principled framework for optimal linear filtering and smoothing in the two-signal setting, significantly expanding the toolkit for analyzing dynamic interactions in multivariate time-series.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |

The process begins with a denoising autoencoder to filter out random noise fluctuations from the main contract price data. Then, one-dimensional convolution reduces the dimensionality of the filtered data and extracts key information. The filtered and dimensionality-reduced price data is fed into a GANs network, and its output serve as input of a fully connected network. Through cross-validation, a model is trained to capture features that precede large price fluctuations. The model predicts the likelihood and direction of significant price changes in real-time price sequences, placing trades at moments of high prediction accuracy. Empirical results demonstrate that using autoencoders and convolution to filter and denoise financial data, combined with GANs, achieves a certain level of predictive performance, validating the capabilities of machine learning algorithms to discover underlying patterns in financial sequences.

We propose using data sampled from the real model $\mathbb P$ (which is unknown) with limited size to train a generative model $\mathbb Q$ (from which we can easily and adequately sample). With adaptive training and sampling methods that are tailor-made for time series data, we obtain quantification bounds between $\mathbb P$ and $\mathbb Q$ in terms of the adapted Wasserstein metric $\mathcal A W_2$. Importantly, the proposed adapted sampling method also facilitates {\it conditional sampling}. In the second part of this paper, we provide the stability of the mean-variance portfolio optimization problems in $\mathcal A W _2$. Then, combined with the error bounds and the stability result, we propose a policy gradient algorithm based on the generative environment, in which our innovative adapted sampling method provides approximate scenario generators. We illustrate the performance of our algorithm on both simulated and real data. For real data, the algorithm based on the generative environment produces portfolios that beat several important baselines, including the Markowitz portfolio, the equal weight (naive) portfolio, and S\&P 500.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available on https://github.com/fy-yuan/diffusion_dynamic_mv. v2 addresses certain typos and small issues</p></details> |

TCP integrates a machine learning-based quantile forecaster with an online conformal calibration layer. This layer's thresholds are updated via a modified Robbins-Monro scheme, allowing the model to dynamically adapt to volatility clustering and regime shifts without rigid parametric assumptions. We benchmark TCP against GARCH, Historical Simulation, and static Quantile Regression across diverse financial assets. Our empirical results reveal a critical flaw in static methods: while sharp, Quantile Regression is poorly calibrated, systematically over-covering the nominal 95% target. In contrast, TCP's adaptive mechanism actively works to achieve the correct coverage level, successfully navigating the coverage-sharpness tradeoff. Visualizations during the 2020 market crash confirm TCP's superior adaptive response, and a comprehensive sensitivity analysis demonstrates the framework's robustness to hyperparameter choices. Overall, TCP offers a practical and theoretically-grounded solution to the central challenge of calibrated uncertainty quantification for time series under distribution shift, advancing the interface between statistical inference and machine learning.</p></details> |  |

These fused representations are used to continuously adjust two critical gait parameters (step height and hip splay), enabling adaptive gaits that respond dynamically to varying terrain conditions. To generate terrain representations, we process visual inputs through a masked Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder and time-series data through a dilated causal convolutional encoder. The Cross Attention mechanism then selects and integrates the most relevant features from each modality, combining terrain characteristics with robot dynamics for informed gait adaptation. This fused representation allows CROSS-GAiT to continuously adjust gait parameters in response to unpredictable terrain conditions in real-time. We train CROSS-GAiT on a diverse set of terrains including asphalt, concrete, brick pavements, grass, dense vegetation, pebbles, gravel, and sand and validate its generalization ability on unseen environments. Our hardware implementation on the Ghost Robotics Vision 60 demonstrates superior performance in challenging terrains, such as high-density vegetation, unstable surfaces, sandbanks, and deformable substrates. We observe at least a 7.04% reduction in IMU energy density and a 27.3% reduction in total joint effort, which directly correlates with increased stability and reduced energy usage when compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, CROSS-GAiT demonstrates at least a 64.5% increase in success rate and a 4.91% reduction in time to reach the goal in four complex scenarios. Additionally, the learned representations perform 4.48% better than the state-of-the-art on a terrain classification task.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we will study the impact of noise on the learning capabilities of analog reservoir computers. Recent work on reservoir computation has shown that the information processing capacity (IPC) is a useful metric for quantifying the degradation of the performance due to noise. We further this analysis and demonstrate that this degradation of the IPC limits the possible features that can be meaningfully constructed in an analog reservoir computing setting. We borrow a result from quantum complexity theory that relates the circuit model of computation to a continuous time model, and demonstrate an exponential reduction in the accessible volume of reservoir configurations. We conclude by relating this degradation in the IPC to the fat-shattering dimension of a family of functions describing the reservoir dynamics, which allows us to express our result in terms of a classification task. We conclude that any physical, analog reservoir computer that is exposed to noise can only be used to perform a polynomial amount of learning, despite the exponentially large latent space, even with an exponential amount of post-processing.</p></details> | 12 pages, 1 figure |

Learning Latent Hierarchical Channel Structure for High-Dimensional Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15119v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting (TSF) is a central problem in time series analysis. However, as the number of channels in time series datasets scales to the thousands or more, a scenario we define as High-Dimensional Time Series Forecasting (HDTSF), it introduces significant new modeling challenges that are often not the primary focus of traditional TSF research. HDTSF is challenging because the channel correlation often forms complex and hierarchical patterns. Existing TSF models either ignore these interactions or fail to scale as dimensionality grows. To address this issue, we propose U-Cast, a channel-dependent forecasting architecture that learns latent hierarchical channel structures with an innovative query-based attention. To disentangle highly correlated channel representation, U-Cast adds a full-rank regularization during training. We also release Time-HD, a benchmark of large, diverse, high-dimensional datasets. Our theory shows that exploiting cross-channel information lowers forecasting risk, and experiments on Time-HD demonstrate that U-Cast surpasses strong baselines in both accuracy and efficiency. Together, U-Cast and Time-HD provide a solid basis for future HDTSF research.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, we propose a novel task, Time-series Reasoning for Anomaly (Time-RA) that transforms classical time series anomaly detection from a discriminative into a generative, reasoning-intensive task leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). Also, we introduce the first real-world multimodal benchmark dataset, RATs40K, explicitly annotated for anomaly reasoning, comprising approximately 40,000 samples across 10 real-world domains. Each sample includes numeric time series data, contextual text information, and visual representations, each annotated with fine-grained categories (14 types for univariate anomalies and 6 for multivariate anomalies) and structured explanatory reasoning. We develop a sophisticated annotation framework utilizing ensemble-generated labels refined through GPT-4-driven feedback, ensuring accuracy and interpretability. Extensive benchmarking of LLMs and multimodal LLMs demonstrates the capabilities and limitations of current models, highlighting the critical role of supervised fine-tuning. Our dataset and task pave the way for significant advancements in interpretable time series anomaly detection and reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review. 19 pages, 8 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |

We fit two linear slopes to the data with the constraint that they merge at the point in time where the slope changes. We compare such fits to a standard linear regression in two ways: We use Akaike's and the Bayesian information criteria for model selection, and we test against the null hypothesis of no change of the trend value. For those grid points where the dual linear fit is superior, we construct maps of the time when the trend changes, and of the warming trends in both time intervals. In doing so, we indentify areas where warming speeds up, but find as well areas where warming slows down. We thereby contribute to the characterization of local effects of climate change. We find that many grid points exhibit a change to a much stronger warming trend around the 1980s. This raises the question of whether the climate system has already passed some tipping point.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |

Exploring time-varying data is critical for data science practitioners aiming to understand dynamic behaviors and discover periodic patterns and trends. However, the analysis of such data often requires sophisticated procedures and tools. Information visualization is a communication channel that leverages human perceptual abilities to transform abstract data into visual representations. Visualization techniques have been successfully applied in the context of time series to enhance interpretability by graphically representing the temporal evolution of data. The challenge for information visualization developers lies in integrating a wide range of analytical tools into rich visualization systems that can summarize complex datasets while clearly describing the impacts of the temporal component. Such systems enable data scientists to turn raw data into understandable and potentially useful knowledge. This review examines techniques and approaches designed for handling time series data, guiding users through knowledge discovery processes based on visual analysis. We also provide readers with theoretical insights and design guidelines for considering when developing comprehensive information visualization approaches for time series, with a particular focus on time series with multiple features. As a result, we highlight the challenges and future research directions to address open questions in the visualization of time-dependent data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[5G Traffic Prediction with Time Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03781v2)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In today's day and age, a mobile phone has become a basic requirement needed for anyone to thrive. With the cellular traffic demand increasing so dramatically, it is now necessary to accurately predict the user traffic in cellular networks, so as to improve the performance in terms of resource allocation and utilisation. Since traffic learning and prediction is a classical and appealing field, which still yields many meaningful results, there has been an increasing interest in leveraging Machine Learning tools to analyse the total traffic served in a given region, to optimise the operation of the network. With the help of this project, we seek to exploit the traffic history by using it to predict the nature and occurrence of future traffic. Furthermore, we classify the traffic into particular application types, to increase our understanding of the nature of the traffic. By leveraging the power of machine learning and identifying its usefulness in the field of cellular networks we try to achieve three main objectives - classification of the application generating the traffic, prediction of packet arrival intensity and burst occurrence. The design of the prediction and classification system is done using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model. The LSTM predictor developed in this experiment would return the number of uplink packets and also estimate the probability of burst occurrence in the specified future time interval. For the purpose of classification, the regression layer in our LSTM prediction model is replaced by a softmax classifier which is used to classify the application generating the cellular traffic into one of the four applications including surfing, video calling, voice calling, and video streaming.</p></details> | 5 pages, 5 figures |

Specifically, we explore whether an adaptive margin (eMargin), adjusted based on a predefined similarity threshold, can improve the separation between adjacent but dissimilar time steps and subsequently lead to better performance in downstream tasks. Our study evaluates the impact of this modification on clustering performance and classification in three benchmark datasets. Our findings, however, indicate that achieving high scores on unsupervised clustering metrics does not necessarily imply that the learned embeddings are meaningful or effective in downstream tasks. To be specific, eMargin added to InfoNCE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in unsupervised clustering metrics, but struggles to achieve competitive results in downstream classification with linear probing.

| **[A Transformer-Based Conditional GAN with Multiple Instance Learning for UAV Signal Detection and Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14592v1)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly used in surveillance, logistics, agriculture, disaster management, and military operations. Accurate detection and classification of UAV flight states, such as hovering, cruising, ascending, or transitioning, which are essential for safe and effective operations. However, conventional time series classification (TSC) methods often lack robustness and generalization for dynamic UAV environments, while state of the art(SOTA) models like Transformers and LSTM based architectures typically require large datasets and entail high computational costs, especially with high-dimensional data streams. This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates a Transformer-based Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with Multiple Instance Locally Explainable Learning (MILET) to address these challenges in UAV flight state classification. The Transformer encoder captures long-range temporal dependencies and complex telemetry dynamics, while the GAN module augments limited datasets with realistic synthetic samples. MIL is incorporated to focus attention on the most discriminative input segments, reducing noise and computational overhead. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves superior accuracy 96.5% on the DroneDetect dataset and 98.6% on the DroneRF dataset that outperforming other SOTA approaches. The framework also demonstrates strong computational efficiency and robust generalization across diverse UAV platforms and flight states, highlighting its potential for real-time deployment in resource constrained environments.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Diffusion Models for Time Series Forecasting: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14507v1)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models, initially developed for image synthesis, demonstrate remarkable generative capabilities. Recently, their application has expanded to time series forecasting (TSF), yielding promising results. In this survey, we firstly introduce the standard diffusion models and their prevalent variants, explaining their adaptation to TSF tasks. We then provide a comprehensive review of diffusion models for TSF, paying special attention to the sources of conditional information and the mechanisms for integrating this conditioning within the models. In analyzing existing approaches using diffusion models for TSF, we provide a systematic categorization and a comprehensive summary of them in this survey. Furthermore, we examine several foundational diffusion models applied to TSF, alongside commonly used datasets and evaluation metrics. Finally, we discuss current limitations in these approaches and potential future research directions. Overall, this survey details recent progress and future prospects for diffusion models in TSF, serving as a reference for researchers in the field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bivariate generalized autoregressive models for forecasting bivariate non-Gaussian times series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14442v1)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel approach, the bivariate generalized autoregressive (BGAR) model, for modeling and forecasting bivariate time series data. The BGAR model generalizes the bivariate vector autoregressive (VAR) models by allowing data that does not necessarily follow a normal distribution. We consider a random vector of two time series and assume each belongs to the canonical exponential family, similarly to the univariate generalized autoregressive moving average (GARMA) model. We include autoregressive terms of one series into the dynamical structure of the other and vice versa. The model parameters are estimated using the conditional maximum likelihood (CML) method. We provide general closed-form expressions for the conditional score vector and conditional Fisher information matrix, encompassing all canonical exponential family distributions. We develop asymptotic confidence intervals and hypothesis tests. We discuss techniques for model selection, residual diagnostic analysis, and forecasting. We carry out Monte Carlo simulation studies to evaluate the performance of the finite sample CML inferences, including point and interval estimation. An application to real data analyzes the number of leptospirosis cases on hospitalizations due to leptospirosis in S\~ao Paulo state, Brazil. Competing models such as GARMA, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), and VAR models are considered for comparison purposes. The new model outperforms the competing models by providing more accurate out-of-sample forecasting and allowing quantification of the lagged effect of the case count series on hospitalizations due to leptospirosis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Recursive variational Gaussian approximation with the Whittle likelihood for linear non-Gaussian state space models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15998v3)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameter inference for linear and non-Gaussian state space models is challenging because the likelihood function contains an intractable integral over the latent state variables. While Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods provide exact samples from the posterior distribution as the number of samples goes to infinity, they tend to have high computational cost, particularly for observations of a long time series. When inference with MCMC methods is computationally expensive, variational Bayes (VB) methods are a useful alternative. VB methods approximate the posterior density of the parameters with a simple and tractable distribution found through optimisation. This work proposes a novel sequential VB approach that makes use of the Whittle likelihood for computationally efficient parameter inference in linear, non-Gaussian state space models. Our algorithm, called Recursive Variational Gaussian Approximation with the Whittle Likelihood (R-VGA-Whittle), updates the variational parameters by processing data in the frequency domain. At each iteration, R-VGA-Whittle requires the gradient and Hessian of the Whittle log-likelihood, which are available in closed form. Through several examples involving a linear Gaussian state space model; a univariate/bivariate stochastic volatility model; and a state space model with Student's t measurement error, where the latent states follow an autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average (ARFIMA) model, we show that R-VGA-Whittle provides good approximations to posterior distributions of the parameters, and that it is very computationally efficient when compared to asymptotically exact methods such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.</p></details> |  |
| **[SensorChat: Answering Qualitative and Quantitative Questions during Long-Term Multimodal Sensor Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02883v3)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural language interaction with sensing systems is crucial for addressing users' personal concerns and providing health-related insights into their daily lives. When a user asks a question, the system automatically analyzes the full history of sensor data, extracts relevant information, and generates an appropriate response. However, existing systems are limited to short-duration (e.g., one minute) or low-frequency (e.g., daily step count) sensor data. In addition, they struggle with quantitative questions that require precise numerical answers. In this work, we introduce SensorChat, the first end-to-end QA system designed for daily life monitoring using long-duration, high-frequency time series data. Given raw sensor signals spanning multiple days and a user-defined natural language question, SensorChat generates semantically meaningful responses that directly address user concerns. SensorChat effectively handles both quantitative questions that require numerical precision and qualitative questions that require high-level reasoning to infer subjective insights. To achieve this, SensorChat uses an innovative three-stage pipeline including question decomposition, sensor data query, and answer assembly. The first and third stages leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret human queries and generate responses. The intermediate querying stage extracts relevant information from the complete sensor data history. Real-world implementations demonstrate SensorChat's capability for real-time interactions on a cloud server while also being able to run entirely on edge platforms after quantization. Comprehensive QA evaluations show that SensorChat achieves 93% higher answer accuracy than the best performing state-of-the-art systems on quantitative questions. Furthermore, a user study with eight volunteers highlights SensorChat's effectiveness in answering qualitative questions.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in IMWUT'25.

| **[Smarter Together: Combining Large Language Models and Small Models for Physiological Signals Visual Inspection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16215v2)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities in visually interpreting medical time-series data. However, their general-purpose design can limit domain-specific precision, and the proprietary nature of many models poses challenges for fine-tuning on specialized clinical datasets. Conversely, small specialized models (SSMs) offer strong performance on focused tasks but lack the broader reasoning needed for complex medical decision-making. To address these complementary limitations, we introduce \ConMIL{} (Conformalized Multiple Instance Learning), a novel decision-support framework distinctively synergizes three key components: (1) a new Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) mechanism, QTrans-Pooling, designed for per-class interpretability in identifying clinically relevant physiological signal segments; (2) conformal prediction, integrated with MIL to generate calibrated, set-valued outputs with statistical reliability guarantees; and (3) a structured approach for these interpretable and uncertainty-quantified SSM outputs to enhance the visual inspection capabilities of LLMs. Our experiments on arrhythmia detection and sleep stage classification demonstrate that \ConMIL{} can enhance the accuracy of LLMs such as ChatGPT4.0, Qwen2-VL-7B, and MiMo-VL-7B-RL. For example, \ConMIL{}-supported Qwen2-VL-7B and MiMo-VL-7B-RL both achieves 94.92% and 96.82% precision on confident samples and (70.61% and 78.02%)/(78.10% and 71.98%) on uncertain samples for the two tasks, compared to 46.13% and 13.16% using the LLM alone. These results suggest that integrating task-specific models with LLMs may offer a promising pathway toward more interpretable and trustworthy AI-driven clinical decision support.</p></details> |  |
| **[Comparing skill of historical rainfall data based monsoon rainfall prediction in India with NWP forecasts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07851v2)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Indian summer monsoon is a highly complex and critical weather system that directly affects the livelihoods of over a billion people across the Indian subcontinent. Accurate short-term forecasting remains a major scientific challenge due to the monsoon's intrinsic nonlinearity and its sensitivity to multi-scale drivers, including local land-atmosphere interactions and large-scale ocean-atmosphere phenomena. In this study, we address the problem of forecasting daily rainfall across India during the summer months, focusing on both one-day and three-day lead times. We use Autoformers - deep learning transformer-based architectures designed for time series forecasting. These are trained on historical gridded precipitation data from the Indian Meteorological Department (1901--2023) at spatial resolutions of $0.25^\circ \times 0.25^\circ$, as well as $1^\circ \times 1^\circ$. The models also incorporate auxiliary meteorological variables from ECMWFs reanalysis datasets, namely, cloud cover, humidity, temperature, soil moisture, vorticity, and wind speed. Forecasts at $0.25^\circ \times 0.25^\circ$ are benchmarked against ECMWFs High-Resolution Ensemble System (HRES), widely regarded as the most accurate numerical weather predictor, and at $1^\circ \times 1^\circ $ with those from National Centre for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). We conduct both nationwide evaluations and localized analyses for major Indian cities. Our results indicate that transformer-based deep learning models consistently outperform both HRES and NCEP, as well as other climatological baselines. Specifically, compared to our model, forecasts from HRES and NCEP model have about 22\% and 43\% higher error, respectively, for a single day prediction, and over 27\% and 66\% higher error respectively, for a three day prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Bayesian Dirichlet Auto-Regressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity Model for Compositional Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14132v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We analyze daily Airbnb service-fee shares across eleven settlement currencies, a compositional series that shows bursts of volatility after shocks such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Standard Dirichlet time series models assume constant precision and therefore miss these episodes. We introduce B-DARMA-DARCH, a Bayesian Dirichlet autoregressive moving average model with a Dirichlet ARCH component, which lets the precision parameter follow an ARMA recursion. The specification preserves the Dirichlet likelihood so forecasts remain valid compositions while capturing clustered volatility. Simulations and out-of-sample tests show that B-DARMA-DARCH lowers forecast error and improves interval calibration relative to Dirichlet ARMA and log-ratio VARMA benchmarks, providing a concise framework for settings where both the level and the volatility of proportions matter.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Temporal Causal Representation Learning with Tensor Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14126v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal causal representation learning is a powerful tool for uncovering complex patterns in observational studies, which are often represented as low-dimensional time series. However, in many real-world applications, data are high-dimensional with varying input lengths and naturally take the form of irregular tensors. To analyze such data, irregular tensor decomposition is critical for extracting meaningful clusters that capture essential information. In this paper, we focus on modeling causal representation learning based on the transformed information. First, we present a novel causal formulation for a set of latent clusters. We then propose CaRTeD, a joint learning framework that integrates temporal causal representation learning with irregular tensor decomposition. Notably, our framework provides a blueprint for downstream tasks using the learned tensor factors, such as modeling latent structures and extracting causal information, and offers a more flexible regularization design to enhance tensor decomposition. Theoretically, we show that our algorithm converges to a stationary point. More importantly, our results fill the gap in theoretical guarantees for the convergence of state-of-the-art irregular tensor decomposition. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world electronic health record (EHR) datasets (MIMIC-III), with extensive benchmarks from both phenotyping and network recovery perspectives, demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and enhances the explainability of causal representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Practical Operation of Deep Reinforcement Learning Agents in Real-World Network Management at Open RAN Edges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23086v2)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as a powerful solution for meeting the growing demands for connectivity, reliability, low latency and operational efficiency in advanced networks. However, most research has focused on theoretical analysis and simulations, with limited investigation into real-world deployment. To bridge the gap and support practical DRL deployment for network management, we first present an orchestration framework that integrates ETSI Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) with Open RAN, enabling seamless adoption of DRL-based strategies across different time scales while enhancing agent lifecycle management. We then identify three critical challenges hindering DRL's real-world deployment, including (1) asynchronous requests from unpredictable or bursty traffic, (2) adaptability and generalization across heterogeneous topologies and evolving service demands, and (3) prolonged convergence and service interruptions due to exploration in live operational environments. To address these challenges, we propose a three-fold solution strategy: (a) advanced time-series integration for handling asynchronized traffic, (b) flexible architecture design such as multi-agent DRL and incremental learning to support heterogeneous scenarios, and (c) simulation-driven deployment with transfer learning to reduce convergence time and service disruptions. Lastly, the feasibility of the MEC-O-RAN architecture is validated on an urban-wide testing infrastructure, and two real-world use cases are presented, showcasing the three identified challenges and demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[ParallelTime: Dynamically Weighting the Balance of Short- and Long-Term Temporal Dependencies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13998v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern multivariate time series forecasting primarily relies on two architectures: the Transformer with attention mechanism and Mamba. In natural language processing, an approach has been used that combines local window attention for capturing short-term dependencies and Mamba for capturing long-term dependencies, with their outputs averaged to assign equal weight to both. We find that for time-series forecasting tasks, assigning equal weight to long-term and short-term dependencies is not optimal. To mitigate this, we propose a dynamic weighting mechanism, ParallelTime Weighter, which calculates interdependent weights for long-term and short-term dependencies for each token based on the input and the model's knowledge. Furthermore, we introduce the ParallelTime architecture, which incorporates the ParallelTime Weighter mechanism to deliver state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks. Our architecture demonstrates robustness, achieves lower FLOPs, requires fewer parameters, scales effectively to longer prediction horizons, and significantly outperforms existing methods. These advances highlight a promising path for future developments of parallel Attention-Mamba in time series forecasting.

| **[GRAM-MAMBA: Holistic Feature Alignment for Wireless Perception with Adaptive Low-Rank Compensation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13803v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal fusion is crucial for Internet of Things (IoT) perception, widely deployed in smart homes, intelligent transport, industrial automation, and healthcare. However, existing systems often face challenges: high model complexity hinders deployment in resource-constrained environments, unidirectional modal alignment neglects inter-modal relationships, and robustness suffers when sensor data is missing. These issues impede efficient and robust multimodal perception in real-world IoT settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose GRAM-MAMBA. This framework utilizes the linear-complexity Mamba model for efficient sensor time-series processing, combined with an optimized GRAM matrix strategy for pairwise alignment among modalities, addressing the shortcomings of traditional single-modality alignment. Inspired by Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we introduce an adaptive low-rank layer compensation strategy to handle missing modalities post-training. This strategy freezes the pre-trained model core and irrelevant adaptive layers, fine-tuning only those related to available modalities and the fusion process. Extensive experiments validate GRAM-MAMBA's effectiveness. On the SPAWC2021 indoor positioning dataset, the pre-trained model shows lower error than baselines; adapting to missing modalities yields a 24.5% performance boost by training less than 0.2% of parameters. On the USC-HAD human activity recognition dataset, it achieves 93.55% F1 and 93.81% Overall Accuracy (OA), outperforming prior work; the update strategy increases F1 by 23% while training less than 0.3% of parameters. These results highlight GRAM-MAMBA's potential for achieving efficient and robust multimodal perception in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pseudo-variance quasi-maximum likelihood estimation of semi-parametric time series models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06100v2)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel estimation approach for a general class of semi-parametric time series models where the conditional expectation is modeled through a parametric function. The proposed class of estimators is based on a Gaussian quasi-likelihood function and it relies on the specification of a parametric pseudo-variance that can contain parametric restrictions with respect to the conditional expectation. The specification of the pseudo-variance and the parametric restrictions follow naturally in observation-driven models with bounds in the support of the observable process, such as count processes and double-bounded time series. We derive the asymptotic properties of the estimators and a validity test for the parameter restrictions. We show that the results remain valid irrespective of the correct specification of the pseudo-variance. The key advantage of the restricted estimators is that they can achieve higher efficiency compared to alternative quasi-likelihood methods that are available in the literature. Furthermore, the testing approach can be used to build specification tests for parametric time series models. We illustrate the practical use of the methodology in a simulation study and two empirical applications featuring integer-valued autoregressive processes, where assumptions on the dispersion of the thinning operator are formally tested, and autoregressions for double-bounded data with application to a realized correlation time series.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Journal of Econometrics</p></details> |
| **[Two-stage weighted least squares estimator of multivariate non-negative observation-driven models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13487v2)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A novel estimation approach for a general class of semi-parametric multivariate time series models is introduced where the conditional mean is modeled through parametric functions. The focus of the estimation is the conditional mean parameter vector for non-negative time series. Quasi-Maximum Likelihood Estimators (QMLEs) based on the linear exponential family are typically employed for such estimation problems when the true multivariate conditional probability distribution is unknown or too complex. Although QMLEs provide consistent estimates they may be inefficient. Novel two-stage Multivariate Weighted Least Square Estimators (MWLSEs) are introduced which enjoy the same consistency property as the QMLEs but provide improved efficiency with a suitable choice of the weighting sequence of matrices in the second stage. The proposed method enables a more accurate estimation of model parameters, particularly for data where maximum likelihood estimation is infeasible. Moreover, consistency and asymptotic normality of MWLSEs are derived, and their efficiency is proved under the correct specification of the weighting sequence. The estimation performance of QMLE and MWLSE is also compared through simulation experiments and a real data application, showing the superior accuracy of the proposed methodology.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Econometrics and Statistics</p></details> |

In this study, we revisit classical machine learning based image classification through a novel approach centered on Permutation Entropy (PE), a robust and computationally lightweight measure traditionally used in time series analysis but rarely applied to image data. We extend PE to two-dimensional images and propose a multiscale, multi-orientation entropy-based feature extraction approach that characterizes spatial order and complexity along rows, columns, diagonals, anti-diagonals, and local patches of the image. To enhance the discriminatory power of the entropy features, we integrate two classic image descriptors: the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) to capture shape and edge structure, and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) to encode micro-texture of an image. The resulting hand-crafted feature set, comprising of 780 dimensions, is used to train Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers optimized through grid search. The proposed approach is evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets, including Fashion-MNIST, KMNIST, EMNIST, and CIFAR-10, where it delivers competitive classification performance without relying on deep architectures. Our results demonstrate that the fusion of PE with HOG and LBP provides a compact, interpretable, and effective alternative to computationally expensive and limited interpretable deep learning models. This shows a potential of entropy-based descriptors in image classification and contributes a lightweight and generalizable solution to interpretable machine learning in image classification and computer vision.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoTM: Towards a Foundation Model for Time Series Imputation based on Continuous Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13207v2)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed a growing interest for time series foundation models, with a strong emphasis on the forecasting task. Yet, the crucial task of out-of-domain imputation of missing values remains largely underexplored. We propose a first step to fill this gap by leveraging implicit neural representations (INRs). INRs model time series as continuous functions and naturally handle various missing data scenarios and sampling rates. While they have shown strong performance within specific distributions, they struggle under distribution shifts. To address this, we introduce MoTM (Mixture of Timeflow Models), a step toward a foundation model for time series imputation. Building on the idea that a new time series is a mixture of previously seen patterns, MoTM combines a basis of INRs, each trained independently on a distinct family of time series, with a ridge regressor that adapts to the observed context at inference. We demonstrate robust in-domain and out-of-domain generalization across diverse imputation scenarios (e.g., block and pointwise missingness, variable sampling rates), paving the way for adaptable foundation imputation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>10th ...</summary><p>10th Workshop on Advanced Analytics and Learning on Temporal Data (AALTD), ECML 2025</p></details> |

Existing methods have significant drawbacks, such as their lack of accuracy in early predictions and their dependence on training and testing within the same year and specific time frames. These issues limit their practical use, particularly with out-of-time data. To address these, the study introduces two innovative architectures, GRU-KAN and LSTM-KAN, which merge Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The proposed models were evaluated against the baseline models (LSTM, GRU, LSTM-Attention, and LSTM-Transformer) in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1 and AUC in different lengths of feature window, sample sizes, and early prediction intervals. The results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a prediction accuracy of over 92% three months in advance and over 88% eight months in advance, significantly outperforming existing baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time Series Forecastability Measures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13556v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes using two metrics to quantify the forecastability of time series prior to model development: the spectral predictability score and the largest Lyapunov exponent. Unlike traditional model evaluation metrics, these measures assess the inherent forecastability characteristics of the data before any forecast attempts. The spectral predictability score evaluates the strength and regularity of frequency components in the time series, whereas the Lyapunov exponents quantify the chaos and stability of the system generating the data. We evaluated the effectiveness of these metrics on both synthetic and real-world time series from the M5 forecast competition dataset. Our results demonstrate that these two metrics can correctly reflect the inherent forecastability of a time series and have a strong correlation with the actual forecast performance of various models. By understanding the inherent forecastability of time series before model training, practitioners can focus their planning efforts on products and supply chain levels that are more forecastable, while setting appropriate expectations or seeking alternative strategies for products with limited forecastability.</p></details> |  |
| **[SCOPE for Hexapod Gait Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13539v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evolutionary methods have previously been shown to be an effective learning method for walking gaits on hexapod robots. However, the ability of these algorithms to evolve an effective policy rapidly degrades as the input space becomes more complex. This degradation is due to the exponential growth of the solution space, resulting from an increasing parameter count to handle a more complex input. In order to address this challenge, we introduce Sparse Cosine Optimized Policy Evolution (SCOPE). SCOPE utilizes the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to learn directly from the feature coefficients of an input matrix. By truncating the coefficient matrix returned by the DCT, we can reduce the dimensionality of an input while retaining the highest energy features of the original input. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by using SCOPE to learn the gait of a hexapod robot. The hexapod controller is given a matrix input containing time-series information of previous poses, which are then transformed to gait parameters by an evolved policy. In this task, the addition of SCOPE to a reference algorithm achieves a 20% increase in efficacy. SCOPE achieves this result by reducing the total input size of the time-series pose data from 2700 to 54, a 98% decrease. Additionally, SCOPE is capable of compressing an input to any output shape, provided that each output dimension is no greater than the corresponding input dimension. This paper demonstrates that SCOPE is capable of significantly compressing the size of an input to an evolved controller, resulting in a statistically significant gain in efficacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>IJCCI...</summary><p>IJCCI Conference on Evolutionary Computation and Theory and Applications, 2025</p></details> |

The learned representations are used in a downstream clustering task to separate stressed from healthy fields. The resulting stress detection system can be directly applied to data from different years, offering a practical and accessible tool for stress detection in sugar-beets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multiresolution local smoothness detection in non-uniformly sampled multivariate signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13480v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by edge detection based on the decay behavior of wavelet coefficients, we introduce a (near) linear-time algorithm for detecting the local regularity in non-uniformly sampled multivariate signals. Our approach quantifies regularity within the framework of microlocal spaces introduced by Jaffard. The central tool in our analysis is the fast samplet transform, a distributional wavelet transform tailored to scattered data. We establish a connection between the decay of samplet coefficients and the pointwise regularity of multivariate signals. As a by product, we derive decay estimates for functions belonging to classical H\"older spaces and Sobolev-Slobodeckij spaces. While traditional wavelets are effective for regularity detection in low-dimensional structured data, samplets demonstrate robust performance even for higher dimensional and scattered data. To illustrate our theoretical findings, we present extensive numerical studies detecting local regularity of one-, two- and three-dimensional signals, ranging from non-uniformly sampled time series over image segmentation to edge detection in point clouds.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model-Agnostic, Temperature-Informed Sampling Enhances Cross-Year Crop Mapping with Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12885v3)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Crop type classification using optical satellite time series remains limited in its ability to generalize across seasons, particularly when crop phenology shifts due to inter-annual weather variability. This hampers real-world applicability in scenarios where current-year labels are unavailable. In addition, uncertainty quantification is often overlooked, which reduces the reliability of such approaches for operational crop monitoring. Inspired by ecophysiological principles of plant growth, we propose a simple, model-agnostic Thermal-Time-based Temporal Sampling (T3S) method that replaces calendar time with thermal time. By subsampling time series in this biologically meaningful way, our method highlights key periods within the growing season while reducing temporal redundancy and noise. We evaluate the T3S on a multi-year Sentinel-2 dataset covering the entirety of Switzerland, which allows us to assess all applied methods on unseen years. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our approach yields substantial improvements in classification accuracy and, critically, provides well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. Moreover, the T3S method excels in low-data regimes and enables significantly more accurate early-season classification. With just 10% of the training labels, it outperforms the current baseline in both accuracy and uncertainty calibration, and by the end of June, it achieves a performance similar to the full-season baseline model.</p></details> | under review |
| **[PINT: Physics-Informed Neural Time Series Models with Applications to Long-term Inference on WeatherBench 2m-Temperature Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04018v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces PINT (Physics-Informed Neural Time Series Models), a framework that integrates physical constraints into neural time series models to improve their ability to capture complex dynamics. We apply PINT to the ERA5 WeatherBench dataset, focusing on long-term forecasting of 2m-temperature data. PINT incorporates the Simple Harmonic Oscillator Equation as a physics-informed prior, embedding its periodic dynamics into RNN, LSTM, and GRU architectures. This equation's analytical solutions (sine and cosine functions) facilitate rigorous evaluation of the benefits of incorporating physics-informed constraints. By benchmarking against a linear regression baseline derived from its exact solutions, we quantify the impact of embedding physical principles in data-driven models. Unlike traditional time series models that rely on future observations, PINT is designed for practical forecasting. Using only the first 90 days of observed data, it iteratively predicts the next two years, addressing challenges posed by limited real-time updates. Experiments on the WeatherBench dataset demonstrate PINT's ability to generalize, capture periodic trends, and align with physical principles. This study highlights the potential of physics-informed neural models in bridging machine learning and interpretable climate applications. Our models and datasets are publicly available on GitHub: https://github.com/KV-Park.</p></details> |  |
| **[Soft-ECM: An extension of Evidential C-Means for complex data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13417v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clustering based on belief functions has been gaining increasing attention in the machine learning community due to its ability to effectively represent uncertainty and/or imprecision. However, none of the existing algorithms can be applied to complex data, such as mixed data (numerical and categorical) or non-tabular data like time series. Indeed, these types of data are, in general, not represented in a Euclidean space and the aforementioned algorithms make use of the properties of such spaces, in particular for the construction of barycenters. In this paper, we reformulate the Evidential C-Means (ECM) problem for clustering complex data. We propose a new algorithm, Soft-ECM, which consistently positions the centroids of imprecise clusters requiring only a semi-metric. Our experiments show that Soft-ECM present results comparable to conventional fuzzy clustering approaches on numerical data, and we demonstrate its ability to handle mixed data and its benefits when combining fuzzy clustering with semi-metrics such as DTW for time series data.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Power of Architecture: Deep Dive into Transformer Architectures for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13043v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based models have recently become dominant in Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF), yet the variations in their architecture, such as encoder-only, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only designs, raise a crucial question: What Transformer architecture works best for LTSF tasks? However, existing models are often tightly coupled with various time-series-specific designs, making it difficult to isolate the impact of the architecture itself. To address this, we propose a novel taxonomy that disentangles these designs, enabling clearer and more unified comparisons of Transformer architectures. Our taxonomy considers key aspects such as attention mechanisms, forecasting aggregations, forecasting paradigms, and normalization layers. Through extensive experiments, we uncover several key insights: bi-directional attention with joint-attention is most effective; more complete forecasting aggregation improves performance; and the direct-mapping paradigm outperforms autoregressive approaches. Furthermore, our combined model, utilizing optimal architectural choices, consistently outperforms several existing models, reinforcing the validity of our conclusions. We hope these findings offer valuable guidance for future research on Transformer architectural designs in LTSF. Our code is available at https://github.com/HALF111/TSF_architecture.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |

However, conventional analysis techniques often struggle with challenges such as high dimensionality, complex distributions, and sparsity. These limitations hinder the ability to extract meaningful insights from complex temporal datasets, making it difficult to identify trending features, outliers, and anomalies effectively. Inspired by surprisability -- a cognitive science concept describing how humans instinctively focus on unexpected deviations - we propose Learning via Surprisability (LvS), a novel approach for transforming high-dimensional timeline data. LvS quantifies and prioritizes anomalies in time-series data by formalizing deviations from expected behavior. LvS bridges cognitive theories of attention with computational methods, enabling the detection of anomalies and shifts in a way that preserves critical context, offering a new lens for interpreting complex datasets. We demonstrate the usefulness of LvS on three high-dimensional timeline use cases: a time series of sensor data, a global dataset of mortality causes over multiple years, and a textual corpus containing over two centuries of State of the Union Addresses by U.S. presidents. Our results show that the LvS transformation enables efficient and interpretable identification of outliers, anomalies, and the most variable features along the timeline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Publication in Chaos, May 2025</p></details> |
| **[FLDmamba: Integrating Fourier and Laplace Transform Decomposition with Mamba for Enhanced Time Series Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12803v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series prediction, a crucial task across various domains, faces significant challenges due to the inherent complexities of time series data, including non-stationarity, multi-scale periodicity, and transient dynamics, particularly when tackling long-term predictions. While Transformer-based architectures have shown promise, their quadratic complexity with sequence length hinders their efficiency for long-term predictions. Recent advancements in State-Space Models, such as Mamba, offer a more efficient alternative for long-term modeling, but they cannot capture multi-scale periodicity and transient dynamics effectively. Meanwhile, they are susceptible to data noise issues in time series. This paper proposes a novel framework, FLDmamba (Fourier and Laplace Transform Decomposition Mamba), addressing these limitations. FLDmamba leverages the strengths of both Fourier and Laplace transforms to effectively capture both multi-scale periodicity, transient dynamics within time series data, and improve the robustness of the model to the data noise issue. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that FLDmamba achieves superior performance on time series prediction benchmarks, outperforming both Transformer-based and other Mamba-based architectures. To promote the reproducibility of our method, we have made both the code and data accessible via the following URL:{\href{https://github.com/AI4Science-WestlakeU/FLDmamba}{https://github.com/AI4Science-WestlakeU/\model}.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[Fetuses Made Simple: Modeling and Tracking of Fetal Shape and Pose](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17858v3)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analyzing fetal body motion and shape is paramount in prenatal diagnostics and monitoring. Existing methods for fetal MRI analysis mainly rely on anatomical keypoints or volumetric body segmentations. Keypoints simplify body structure to facilitate motion analysis, but may ignore important details of full-body shape. Body segmentations capture complete shape information but complicate temporal analysis due to large non-local fetal movements. To address these limitations, we construct a 3D articulated statistical fetal body model based on the Skinned Multi-Person Linear Model (SMPL). Our algorithm iteratively estimates body pose in the image space and body shape in the canonical pose space. This approach improves robustness to MRI motion artifacts and intensity distortions, and reduces the impact of incomplete surface observations due to challenging fetal poses. We train our model on segmentations and keypoints derived from $19,816$ MRI volumes across $53$ subjects. Our model captures body shape and motion across time series and provides intuitive visualization. Furthermore, it enables automated anthropometric measurements traditionally difficult to obtain from segmentations and keypoints. When tested on unseen fetal body shapes, our method yields a surface alignment error of $3.2$ mm for $3$ mm MRI voxel size. To our knowledge, this represents the first 3D articulated statistical fetal body model, paving the way for enhanced fetal motion and shape analysis in prenatal diagnostics.

| **[Unifying Explainable Anomaly Detection and Root Cause Analysis in Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12086v3)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamical systems, prevalent in various scientific and engineering domains, are susceptible to anomalies that can significantly impact their performance and reliability. This paper addresses the critical challenges of anomaly detection, root cause localization, and anomaly type classification in dynamical systems governed by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We define two categories of anomalies: cyber anomalies, which propagate through interconnected variables, and measurement anomalies, which remain localized to individual variables. To address these challenges, we propose the Interpretable Causality Ordinary Differential Equation (ICODE) Networks, a model-intrinsic explainable learning framework. ICODE leverages Neural ODEs for anomaly detection while employing causality inference through an explanation channel to perform root cause analysis (RCA), elucidating why specific time periods are flagged as anomalous. ICODE is designed to simultaneously perform anomaly detection, RCA, and anomaly type classification within a single, interpretable framework. Our approach is grounded in the hypothesis that anomalies alter the underlying ODEs of the system, manifesting as changes in causal relationships between variables. We provide a theoretical analysis of how perturbations in learned model parameters can be utilized to identify anomalies and their root causes in time series data. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of ICODE across various dynamical systems, showcasing its ability to accurately detect anomalies, classify their types, and pinpoint their origins.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the AAAI-25 Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Cyber Security (AICS)</p></details> |

This paper explores control methods to reduce peak power consumption at workplace EV charging stations in a joint price and power optimization framework. We optimize a menu of price options to incentivize users to select controllable charging service. Using this framework, we propose several solutions to achieve a reduction in both demand charge and overall operator costs. Through a Monte Carlo simulation, we find that model predictive control using a time series forecast can significantly reduce station operator costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Timing is Important: Risk-aware Fund Allocation based on Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24835v3)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fund allocation has been an increasingly important problem in the financial domain. In reality, we aim to allocate the funds to buy certain assets within a certain future period. Naive solutions such as prediction-only or Predict-then-Optimize approaches suffer from goal mismatch. Additionally, the introduction of the SOTA time series forecasting model inevitably introduces additional uncertainty in the predicted result. To solve both problems mentioned above, we introduce a Risk-aware Time-Series Predict-and-Allocate (RTS-PnO) framework, which holds no prior assumption on the forecasting models. Such a framework contains three features: (i) end-to-end training with objective alignment measurement, (ii) adaptive forecasting uncertainty calibration, and (iii) agnostic towards forecasting models. The evaluation of RTS-PnO is conducted over both online and offline experiments. For offline experiments, eight datasets from three categories of financial applications are used: Currency, Stock, and Cryptos. RTS-PnO consistently outperforms other competitive baselines. The online experiment is conducted on the Cross-Border Payment business at FiT, Tencent, and an 8.4\% decrease in regret is witnessed when compared with the product-line approach. The code for the offline experiment is available at https://github.com/fuyuanlyu/RTS-PnO.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD 2025 ADS Track</p></details> |
