| **[QoQ-Med: Building Multimodal Clinical Foundation Models with Domain-Aware GRPO Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00711v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical decision-making routinely demands reasoning over heterogeneous data, yet existing multimodal language models (MLLMs) remain largely vision-centric and fail to generalize across clinical specialties. To bridge this gap, we introduce QoQ-Med-7B/32B, the first open generalist clinical foundation model that jointly reasons across medical images, time-series signals, and text reports. QoQ-Med is trained with Domain-aware Relative Policy Optimization (DRPO), a novel reinforcement-learning objective that hierarchically scales normalized rewards according to domain rarity and modality difficulty, mitigating performance imbalance caused by skewed clinical data distributions. Trained on 2.61 million instruction tuning pairs spanning 9 clinical domains, we show that DRPO training boosts diagnostic performance by 43% in macro-F1 on average across all visual domains as compared to other critic-free training methods like GRPO. Furthermore, with QoQ-Med trained on intensive segmentation data, it is able to highlight salient regions related to the diagnosis, with an IoU 10x higher than open models while reaching the performance of OpenAI o4-mini. To foster reproducibility and downstream research, we release (i) the full model weights, (ii) the modular training pipeline, and (iii) all intermediate reasoning traces at https://github.com/DDVD233/QoQ_Med.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as Oral at NeurIPS 2025.

| **[Phase-driven Domain Generalizable Learning for Nonstationary Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05960v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pattern recognition is a fundamental task in continuous sensing applications, but real-world scenarios often experience distribution shifts that necessitate learning generalizable representations for such tasks. This challenge is exacerbated with time-series data, which also exhibit inherent nonstationarity--variations in statistical and spectral properties over time. In this work, we offer a fresh perspective on learning generalizable representations for time-series classification by considering the phase information of a signal as an approximate proxy for nonstationarity and propose a phase-driven generalizable representation learning framework for time-series classification, PhASER. It consists of three key elements: 1) Hilbert transform-based augmentation, which diversifies nonstationarity while preserving task-specific discriminatory semantics, 2) separate magnitude-phase encoding, viewing time-varying magnitude and phase as independent modalities, and 3) phase-residual feature broadcasting, integrating 2D phase features with a residual connection to the 1D signal representation, providing inherent regularization to improve distribution-invariant learning. Extensive evaluations on five datasets from sleep-stage classification, human activity recognition, and gesture recognition against 13 state-of-the-art baseline methods demonstrate that PhASER consistently outperforms the best baselines by an average of 5% and up to 11% in some cases. Additionally, the principles of PhASER can be broadly applied to enhance the generalizability of existing time-series representation learning models.</p></details> | TMLR 2025 |
| **[Enabling Granular Subgroup Level Model Evaluations by Generating Synthetic Medical Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19728v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel framework for leveraging synthetic ICU time-series data not only to train but also to rigorously and trustworthily evaluate predictive models, both at the population level and within fine-grained demographic subgroups. Building on prior diffusion and VAE-based generators (TimeDiff, HealthGen, TimeAutoDiff), we introduce \textit{Enhanced TimeAutoDiff}, which augments the latent diffusion objective with distribution-alignment penalties. We extensively benchmark all models on MIMIC-III and eICU, on 24-hour mortality and binary length-of-stay tasks. Our results show that Enhanced TimeAutoDiff reduces the gap between real-on-synthetic and real-on-real evaluation (``TRTS gap'') by over 70\%, achieving $\Delta_{TRTS} \leq 0.014$ AUROC, while preserving training utility ($\Delta_{TSTR} \approx 0.01$). Crucially, for 32 intersectional subgroups, large synthetic cohorts cut subgroup-level AUROC estimation error by up to 50\% relative to small real test sets, and outperform them in 72--84\% of subgroups. This work provides a practical, privacy-preserving roadmap for trustworthy, granular model evaluation in critical care, enabling robust and reliable performance analysis across diverse patient populations without exposing sensitive EHR data, contributing to the overall trustworthiness of Medical AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[SEMPO: Lightweight Foundation Models for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19710v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent boom of large pre-trained models witnesses remarkable success in developing foundation models (FMs) for time series forecasting. Despite impressive performance across diverse downstream forecasting tasks, existing time series FMs possess massive network architectures and require substantial pre-training on large-scale datasets, which significantly hinders their deployment in resource-constrained environments. In response to this growing tension between versatility and affordability, we propose SEMPO, a novel lightweight foundation model that requires pretraining on relatively small-scale data, yet exhibits strong general time series forecasting. Concretely, SEMPO comprises two key modules: 1) energy-aware SpEctral decomposition module, that substantially improves the utilization of pre-training data by modeling not only the high-energy frequency signals but also the low-energy yet informative frequency signals that are ignored in current methods; and 2) Mixture-of-PrOmpts enabled Transformer, that learns heterogeneous temporal patterns through small dataset-specific prompts and adaptively routes time series tokens to prompt-based experts for parameter-efficient model adaptation across different datasets and domains. Equipped with these modules, SEMPO significantly reduces both pre-training data scale and model size, while achieving strong generalization. Extensive experiments on two large-scale benchmarks covering 16 datasets demonstrate the superior performance of SEMPO in both zero-shot and few-shot forecasting scenarios compared with state-of-the-art methods. Code and data are available at https://github.com/mala-lab/SEMPO.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Climate-Aware Deep Learning Framework for Generalizable Epidemic Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19611v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precise outbreak forecasting of infectious diseases is essential for effective public health responses and epidemic control. The increased availability of machine learning (ML) methods for time-series forecasting presents an enticing avenue to enhance outbreak forecasting. Though the COVID-19 outbreak demonstrated the value of applying ML models to predict epidemic profiles, using ML models to forecast endemic diseases remains underexplored. In this work, we present ForecastNet-XCL (an ensemble model based on XGBoost+CNN+BiLSTM), a deep learning hybrid framework designed to addresses this gap by creating accurate multi-week RSV forecasts up to 100 weeks in advance based on climate and temporal data, without access to real-time surveillance on RSV. The framework combines high-resolution feature learning with long-range temporal dependency capturing mechanisms, bolstered by an autoregressive module trained on climate-controlled lagged relations. Stochastic inference returns probabilistic intervals to inform decision-making. Evaluated across 34 U.S. states, ForecastNet-XCL reliably outperformed statistical baselines, individual neural nets, and conventional ensemble methods in both within- and cross-state scenarios, sustaining accuracy over extended forecast horizons. Training on climatologically diverse datasets enhanced generalization furthermore, particularly in locations having irregular or biennial RSV patterns. ForecastNet-XCL's efficiency, performance, and uncertainty-aware design make it a deployable early-warning tool amid escalating climate pressures and constrained surveillance resources.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Prototypes to Sparse ECG Explanations: SHAP-Driven Counterfactuals for Multivariate Time-Series Multi-class Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19514v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), instance-based explanations for time series have gained increasing attention due to their potential for actionable and interpretable insights in domains such as healthcare. Addressing the challenges of explainability of state-of-the-art models, we propose a prototype-driven framework for generating sparse counterfactual explanations tailored to 12-lead ECG classification models. Our method employs SHAP-based thresholds to identify critical signal segments and convert them into interval rules, uses Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and medoid clustering to extract representative prototypes, and aligns these prototypes to query R-peaks for coherence with the sample being explained. The framework generates counterfactuals that modify only 78% of the original signal while maintaining 81.3% validity across all classes and achieving 43% improvement in temporal stability. We evaluate three variants of our approach, Original, Sparse, and Aligned Sparse, with class-specific performance ranging from 98.9% validity for myocardial infarction (MI) to challenges with hypertrophy (HYP) detection (13.2%). This approach supports near realtime generation (< 1 second) of clinically valid counterfactuals and provides a foundation for interactive explanation platforms. Our findings establish design principles for physiologically-aware counterfactual explanations in AI-based diagnosis systems and outline pathways toward user-controlled explanation interfaces for clinical deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeWak: Temporal Chained-Hashing Watermark for Time Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06407v3)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic time series generated by diffusion models enable sharing privacy-sensitive datasets, such as patients' functional MRI records. Key criteria for synthetic data include high data utility and traceability to verify the data source. Recent watermarking methods embed in homogeneous latent spaces, but state-of-the-art time series generators operate in data space, making latent-based watermarking incompatible. This creates the challenge of watermarking directly in data space while handling feature heterogeneity and temporal dependencies. We propose TimeWak, the first watermarking algorithm for multivariate time series diffusion models. To handle temporal dependence and spatial heterogeneity, TimeWak embeds a temporal chained-hashing watermark directly within the temporal-feature data space. The other unique feature is the $\epsilon$-exact inversion, which addresses the non-uniform reconstruction error distribution across features from inverting the diffusion process to detect watermarks. We derive the error bound of inverting multivariate time series while preserving robust watermark detectability. We extensively evaluate TimeWak on its impact on synthetic data quality, watermark detectability, and robustness under various post-editing attacks, against five datasets and baselines of different temporal lengths. Our results show that TimeWak achieves improvements of 61.96% in context-FID score, and 8.44% in correlational scores against the strongest state-of-the-art baseline, while remaining consistently detectable.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Feedback Discovery using Convergence Cross Mapping on Sea Ice Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09001v5)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying causal relationships in climate systems remains challenging due to nonlinear, coupled dynamics that limit the effectiveness of linear and stochastic causal discovery approaches. This study benchmarks Convergence Cross Mapping (CCM) against Granger causality, PCMCI, and VarLiNGAM using both synthetic datasets with ground truth causal links and 41 years of Arctic climate data (1979--2021). Unlike stochastic models that rely on autoregressive residual dependence, CCM leverages Takens' state-space reconstruction and delay-embedding to reconstruct attractor manifolds from time series. Cross mapping between reconstructed manifolds exploits deterministic signatures of causation, enabling the detection of weak and bidirectional causal links that linear models fail to resolve. Results demonstrate that CCM achieves higher specificity and fewer false positives on synthetic benchmarks, while maintaining robustness under observational noise and limited sample lengths. On Arctic data, CCM reveals significant causal interactions between sea ice extent and atmospheric variables like specific humidity, longwave radiation, and surface temperature with a $p$-value of $0.009$, supporting ice-albedo feedbacks and moisture-radiation couplings central to Arctic amplification. In contrast, stochastic approaches miss these nonlinear dependencies or infer spurious causal relations. This work establishes CCM as a robust causal inference tool for nonlinear climate dynamics and provides the first systematic benchmarking framework for method selection in climate research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ACM Sigspatial Conference, PolDS Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Explaining Time Series Classifiers with PHAR: Rule Extraction and Fusion from Post-hoc Attributions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01687v3)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Explaining machine learning (ML) models for time series (TS) classification remains challenging due to the difficulty of interpreting raw time series and the high dimensionality of the input space. We introduce PHAR-Post-hoc Attribution Rules - a unified framework that transforms numeric feature attributions from post-hoc, instance-wise explainers (e.g., LIME, SHAP) into structured, human-readable rules. These rules define human-readable intervals that indicate where and when decision-relevant segments occur and can enhance model transparency by localizing threshold-based conditions on the raw series. PHAR performs comparably to native rule-based methods, such as Anchor, while scaling more efficiently to long TS sequences and achieving broader instance coverage. A dedicated rule fusion step consolidates rule sets using strategies like weighted selection and lasso-based refinement, balancing key quality metrics: coverage, confidence, and simplicity. This fusion ensures each instance receives a concise and unambiguous rule, improving both explanation fidelity and consistency. We further introduce visualization techniques to illustrate specificity-generalization trade-offs in the derived rules. PHAR resolves conflicting and overlapping explanations - a common effect of the Rashomon phenomenon - into coherent, domain-adaptable insights. Comprehensive experiments on UCR/UEA Time Series Classification Archive demonstrate that PHAR may improve interpretability, decision transparency, and practical applicability for TS classification tasks by providing concise, human-readable rules aligned with model predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[LMFD: Latent Monotonic Feature Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19383v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many systems in our world age, degrade or otherwise move slowly but steadily in a certain direction. When monitoring such systems by means of sensors, one often assumes that some form of `age' is latently present in the data, but perhaps the available sensors do not readily provide this useful information. The task that we study in this paper is to extract potential proxies for this `age' from the available multi-variate time series without having clear data on what `age' actually is. We argue that when we find a sensor, or more likely some discovered function of the available sensors, that is sufficiently monotonic, that function can act as the proxy we are searching for. Using a carefully defined grammar and optimising the resulting equations in terms of monotonicity, defined as the absolute Spearman's Rank Correlation between time and the candidate formula, the proposed approach generates a set of candidate features which are then fitted and assessed on monotonicity. The proposed system is evaluated against an artificially generated dataset and two real-world datasets. In all experiments, we show that the system is able to combine sensors with low individual monotonicity into latent features with high monotonicity. For the real-world dataset of InfraWatch, a structural health monitoring project, we show that two features with individual absolute Spearman's $\rho$ values of $0.13$ and $0.09$ can be combined into a proxy with an absolute Spearman's $\rho$ of $0.95$. This demonstrates that our proposed method can find interpretable equations which can serve as a proxy for the `age' of the system.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint has not undergone peer review or any post-submission improvements or corrections.

| **[Foundation Model Forecasts: Form and Function](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19345v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series foundation models (TSFMs) achieve strong forecast accuracy, yet accuracy alone does not determine practical value. The form of a forecast -- point, quantile, parametric, or trajectory ensemble -- fundamentally constrains which operational tasks it can support. We survey recent TSFMs and find that two-thirds produce only point or parametric forecasts, while many operational tasks require trajectory ensembles that preserve temporal dependence. We establish when forecast types can be converted and when they cannot: trajectory ensembles convert to simpler forms via marginalization without additional assumptions, but the reverse requires imposing temporal dependence through copulas or conformal methods. We prove that marginals cannot determine path-dependent event probabilities -- infinitely many joint distributions share identical marginals but yield different answers to operational questions. We map six fundamental forecasting tasks to minimal sufficient forecast types and provide a task-aligned evaluation framework. Our analysis clarifies when forecast type, not accuracy, differentiates practical utility.</p></details> | 28 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Topology of Currencies: Persistent Homology for FX Co-movements: A Comparative Clustering Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19306v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates whether Topological Data Analysis (TDA) can provide additional insights beyond traditional statistical methods in clustering currency behaviours. We focus on the foreign exchange (FX) market, which is a complex system often exhibiting non-linear and high-dimensional dynamics that classical techniques may not fully capture. We compare clustering results based on TDA-derived features versus classical statistical features using monthly logarithmic returns of 13 major currency exchange rates (all against the euro). Two widely-used clustering algorithms, \(k\)-means and Hierarchical clustering, are applied on both types of features, and cluster quality is evaluated via the Silhouette score and the Calinski-Harabasz index. Our findings show that TDA-based feature clustering produces more compact and well-separated clusters than clustering on traditional statistical features, particularly achieving substantially higher Calinski-Harabasz scores. However, all clustering approaches yield modest Silhouette scores, underscoring the inherent difficulty of grouping FX time series. The differing cluster compositions under TDA vs. classical features suggest that TDA captures structural patterns in currency co-movements that conventional methods might overlook. These results highlight TDA as a valuable complementary tool for analysing financial time series, with potential applications in risk management where understanding structural co-movements is crucial.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 17 figures, the results were presented at the 5th MORSE Conference, Maastricht University (October 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Understanding the Implicit Biases of Design Choices for Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19236v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series foundation models (TSFMs) are a class of potentially powerful, general-purpose tools for time series forecasting and related temporal tasks, but their behavior is strongly shaped by subtle inductive biases in their design. Rather than developing a new model and claiming that it is better than existing TSFMs, e.g., by winning on existing well-established benchmarks, our objective is to understand how the various ``knobs'' of the training process affect model quality. Using a mix of theory and controlled empirical evaluation, we identify several design choices (patch size, embedding choice, training objective, etc.) and show how they lead to implicit biases in fundamental model properties (temporal behavior, geometric structure, how aggressively or not the model regresses to the mean, etc.); and we show how these biases can be intuitive or very counterintuitive, depending on properties of the model and data. We also illustrate in a case study on outlier handling how multiple biases can interact in complex ways; and we discuss implications of our results for learning the bitter lesson and building TSFMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[No Intelligence Without Statistics: The Invisible Backbone of Artificial Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19212v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid ascent of artificial intelligence (AI) is often portrayed as a revolution born from computer science and engineering. This narrative, however, obscures a fundamental truth: the theoretical and methodological core of AI is, and has always been, statistical. This paper systematically argues that the field of statistics provides the indispensable foundation for machine learning and modern AI. We deconstruct AI into nine foundational pillars-Inference, Density Estimation, Sequential Learning, Generalization, Representation Learning, Interpretability, Causality, Optimization, and Unification-demonstrating that each is built upon century-old statistical principles. From the inferential frameworks of hypothesis testing and estimation that underpin model evaluation, to the density estimation roots of clustering and generative AI; from the time-series analysis inspiring recurrent networks to the causal models that promise true understanding, we trace an unbroken statistical lineage. While celebrating the computational engines that power modern AI, we contend that statistics provides the brain-the theoretical frameworks, uncertainty quantification, and inferential goals-while computer science provides the brawn-the scalable algorithms and hardware. Recognizing this statistical backbone is not merely an academic exercise, but a necessary step for developing more robust, interpretable, and trustworthy intelligent systems. We issue a call to action for education, research, and practice to re-embrace this statistical foundation. Ignoring these roots risks building a fragile future; embracing them is the path to truly intelligent machines. There is no machine learning without statistical learning; no artificial intelligence without statistical thought.</p></details> | 37 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Benchmarking Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting Models on Neural Activity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18037v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural activity forecasting is central to understanding neural systems and enabling closed-loop control. While deep learning has recently advanced the state-of-the-art in the time series forecasting literature, its application to neural activity forecasting remains limited. To bridge this gap, we systematically evaluated eight probabilistic deep learning models, including two foundation models, that have demonstrated strong performance on general forecasting benchmarks. We compared them against four classical statistical models and two baseline methods on spontaneous neural activity recorded from mouse cortex via widefield imaging. Across prediction horizons, several deep learning models consistently outperformed classical approaches, with the best model producing informative forecasts up to 1.5 seconds into the future. Our findings point toward future control applications and open new avenues for probing the intrinsic temporal structure of neural activity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: Data on the Brain & Mind</p></details> |
| **[News-Aware Direct Reinforcement Trading for Financial Markets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19173v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The financial market is known to be highly sensitive to news. Therefore, effectively incorporating news data into quantitative trading remains an important challenge. Existing approaches typically rely on manually designed rules and/or handcrafted features. In this work, we directly use the news sentiment scores derived from large language models, together with raw price and volume data, as observable inputs for reinforcement learning. These inputs are processed by sequence models such as recurrent neural networks or Transformers to make end-to-end trading decisions. We conduct experiments using the cryptocurrency market as an example and evaluate two representative reinforcement learning algorithms, namely Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). The results demonstrate that our news-aware approach, which does not depend on handcrafted features or manually designed rules, can achieve performance superior to market benchmarks. We further highlight the critical role of time-series information in this process.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[InvarGC: Invariant Granger Causality for Heterogeneous Interventional Time Series under Latent Confounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19138v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Granger causality is widely used for causal structure discovery in complex systems from multivariate time series data. Traditional Granger causality tests based on linear models often fail to detect even mild non-linear causal relationships. Therefore, numerous recent studies have investigated non-linear Granger causality methods, achieving improved performance. However, these methods often rely on two key assumptions: causal sufficiency and known interventional targets. Causal sufficiency assumes the absence of latent confounders, yet their presence can introduce spurious correlations. Moreover, real-world time series data usually come from heterogeneous environments, without prior knowledge of interventions. Therefore, in practice, it is difficult to distinguish intervened environments from non-intervened ones, and even harder to identify which variables or timesteps are affected. To address these challenges, we propose Invariant Granger Causality (InvarGC), which leverages cross-environment heterogeneity to mitigate the effects of latent confounding and to distinguish intervened from non-intervened environments with edge-level granularity, thereby recovering invariant causal relations. In addition, we establish the identifiability under these conditions. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conformal Prediction for Time-series Forecasting with Change Points](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02844v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conformal prediction has been explored as a general and efficient way to provide uncertainty quantification for time series. However, current methods struggle to handle time series data with change points - sudden shifts in the underlying data-generating process. In this paper, we propose a novel Conformal Prediction for Time-series with Change points (CPTC) algorithm, addressing this gap by integrating a model to predict the underlying state with online conformal prediction to model uncertainties in non-stationary time series. We prove CPTC's validity and improved adaptivity in the time series setting under minimum assumptions, and demonstrate CPTC's practical effectiveness on 6 synthetic and real-world datasets, showing improved validity and adaptivity compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conformal Prediction for Signal Temporal Logic Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25473v3)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signal Temporal Logic (STL) inference seeks to extract human-interpretable rules from time-series data, but existing methods lack formal confidence guarantees for the inferred rules. Conformal prediction (CP) is a technique that can provide statistical correctness guarantees, but is typically applied as a post-training wrapper without improving model learning. Instead, we introduce an end-to-end differentiable CP framework for STL inference that enhances both reliability and interpretability of the resulting formulas. We introduce a robustness-based nonconformity score, embed a smooth CP layer directly into training, and employ a new loss function that simultaneously optimizes inference accuracy and CP prediction sets with a single term. Following training, an exact CP procedure delivers statistical guarantees for the learned STL formulas. Experiments on benchmark time-series tasks show that our approach reduces uncertainty in predictions (i.e., it achieves high coverage while reducing prediction set size), and improves accuracy (i.e., the number of misclassifications when using a fixed threshold) over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Encode-then-Decompose Approach to Unsupervised Time Series Anomaly Detection on Contaminated Training Data--Extended Version](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18998v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection is important in modern large-scale systems and is applied in a variety of domains to analyze and monitor the operation of diverse systems. Unsupervised approaches have received widespread interest, as they do not require anomaly labels during training, thus avoiding potentially high costs and having wider applications. Among these, autoencoders have received extensive attention. They use reconstruction errors from compressed representations to define anomaly scores. However, representations learned by autoencoders are sensitive to anomalies in training time series, causing reduced accuracy. We propose a novel encode-then-decompose paradigm, where we decompose the encoded representation into stable and auxiliary representations, thereby enhancing the robustness when training with contaminated time series. In addition, we propose a novel mutual information based metric to replace the reconstruction errors for identifying anomalies. Our proposal demonstrates competitive or state-of-the-art performance on eight commonly used multi- and univariate time series benchmarks and exhibits robustness to time series with different contamination ratios.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages.

| **[Disentanglement Beyond Static vs. Dynamic: A Benchmark and Evaluation Framework for Multi-Factor Sequential Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17313v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning disentangled representations in sequential data is a key goal in deep learning, with broad applications in vision, audio, and time series. While real-world data involves multiple interacting semantic factors over time, prior work has mostly focused on simpler two-factor static and dynamic settings, primarily because such settings make data collection easier, thereby overlooking the inherently multi-factor nature of real-world data. We introduce the first standardized benchmark for evaluating multi-factor sequential disentanglement across six diverse datasets spanning video, audio, and time series. Our benchmark includes modular tools for dataset integration, model development, and evaluation metrics tailored to multi-factor analysis. We additionally propose a post-hoc Latent Exploration Stage to automatically align latent dimensions with semantic factors, and introduce a Koopman-inspired model that achieves state-of-the-art results. Moreover, we show that Vision-Language Models can automate dataset annotation and serve as zero-shot disentanglement evaluators, removing the need for manual labels and human intervention. Together, these contributions provide a robust and scalable foundation for advancing multi-factor sequential disentanglement.</p></details> |  |
| **[In-Context Learning of Stochastic Differential Equations with Foundation Inference Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19049v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) describe dynamical systems where deterministic flows, governed by a drift function, are superimposed with random fluctuations, dictated by a diffusion function. The accurate estimation (or discovery) of these functions from data is a central problem in machine learning, with wide application across the natural and social sciences. Yet current solutions either rely heavily on prior knowledge of the dynamics or involve intricate training procedures. We introduce FIM-SDE (Foundation Inference Model for SDEs), a pretrained recognition model that delivers accurate in-context (or zero-shot) estimation of the drift and diffusion functions of low-dimensional SDEs, from noisy time series data, and allows rapid finetuning to target datasets. Leveraging concepts from amortized inference and neural operators, we (pre)train FIM-SDE in a supervised fashion to map a large set of noisy, discretely observed SDE paths onto the space of drift and diffusion functions. We demonstrate that FIM-SDE achieves robust in-context function estimation across a wide range of synthetic and real-world processes -- from canonical SDE systems (e.g., double-well dynamics or weakly perturbed Lorenz attractors) to stock price recordings and oil-price and wind-speed fluctuations -- while matching the performance of symbolic, Gaussian process and Neural SDE baselines trained on the target datasets. When finetuned to the target processes, we show that FIM-SDE consistently outperforms all these baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025.

| **[Can Large Language Models Adequately Perform Symbolic Reasoning Over Time Series?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03963v3)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uncovering hidden symbolic laws from time series data, as an aspiration dating back to Kepler's discovery of planetary motion, remains a core challenge in scientific discovery and artificial intelligence. While Large Language Models show promise in structured reasoning tasks, their ability to infer interpretable, context-aligned symbolic structures from time series data is still underexplored. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce SymbolBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess symbolic reasoning over real-world time series across three tasks: multivariate symbolic regression, Boolean network inference, and causal discovery. Unlike prior efforts limited to simple algebraic equations, SymbolBench spans a diverse set of symbolic forms with varying complexity. We further propose a unified framework that integrates LLMs with genetic programming to form a closed-loop symbolic reasoning system, where LLMs act both as predictors and evaluators. Our empirical results reveal key strengths and limitations of current models, highlighting the importance of combining domain knowledge, context alignment, and reasoning structure to improve LLMs in automated scientific discovery.</p></details> | version2 |

The domain of industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) is no exception, as raw data typically consists of large amounts of time-series data logging the system's status in regular time intervals. Such data has to be sanity checked and preprocessed to be consumable by data-centric workflows. We introduce CPSLint, a Domain-Specific Language designed to provide data preparation for industrial CPS. We build up on the fact that many raw data collections in the CPS domain require similar actions to render them suitable for Machine-Learning (ML) solutions, e.g., Fault Detection and Identification (FDI) workflows, yet still vary enough to hope for one universally applicable solution. CPSLint's main features include type checking and enforcing constraints through validation and remediation for data columns, such as imputing missing data from surrounding rows. More advanced features cover inference of extra CPS-specific data structures, both column-wise and row-wise. For instance, as row-wise structures, descriptive execution phases are an effective method of data compartmentalisation are extracted and prepared for ML-assisted FDI workflows. We demonstrate CPSLint's features through a proof of concept implementation.</p></details> |  |
| **[A new implementation of Network GARCH Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18599v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Volatility clustering and spillovers are key features of real-world financial time series when there are a lot of cross-sectional financial assets. While network analysis helps connect stocks that are 'similar' or 'correlated', which is effective to link volatility spillovers between stocks, contemporary multivariate ARCH-GARCH formulations struggle to represent structured network dependence and remain parsimonious. We introduce the Generalised Network GARCH (GNGARCH) model as a network volatility model that embeds the GARCH dynamics within the Generalised Network Autoregressive (GNAR) framework, to capture the dynamic volatility of financial asset return by both the asset itself and its 'neighbouring' assets from the constructed virtual network. The proposed volatility model GNGARCH also addresses the limitations for current studies of network GARCH by adapting neighbouring volatility persistence, dynamic conditional covariance updates, and allowing higher-order neighbouring effects rather than only immediate neighbours. This paper provides the model derivation, vectorisation and conversion, stationarity conditions, and also an extension by incorporating threshold coefficients to capture leverage effects. We show that the GNGARCH is a valid volatility model satisfying the stylised facts of financial return series through simulation. Parameter estimation is then performed by using squared returns as variance proxy and minimising a loss function that is either mean squared error (MSE) or quasi-likelihood (QLIKE). We apply our model on 75 of the most active US stocks under a virtual network, and highlight the model's ability in volatility estimation and forecast.</p></details> | <details><summary>Codes...</summary><p>Codes for this paper are accessible at https://github.com/PZhou114/GNGARCH_coding, detailed instructions are in the repository's README.

However, its direct application in finance remains challenging due to substantial differences in data characteristics across domains. Specifically, financial systems feature inherent stochasticity and low signal-to-noise ratios, rendering traditional methods and pre-training approaches ineffective. This underscores the urgent need for a foundation model tailored to financial time series. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{LENS}, a pre-trained model for this domain. \textbf{LENS} effectively captures the complexity of financial stochastic systems through a carefully crafted model architecture and mitigates noise during pre-training by using an invertible embedding module. We provide a rigorous theoretical explanation of the model's effectiveness and validate its performance through extensive experiments. Pre-trained on a dataset comprising 100 billion financial observations, \textbf{LENS} achieves exceptional results across a wide range of critical downstream tasks. Moreover, our work offers practical insights into developing pre-trained time series models in high-noise environments, paving the way for further advancements in this pivotal research domain.</p></details> |  |

Early and accurate sepsis prediction (SP) is critical for timely intervention, yet remains challenging due to subtle early manifestations and rapidly escalating mortality. While AI has improved SP efficiency, existing methods struggle to capture weak early temporal signals. This paper introduces a Multi-Endogenous-view Representation Enhancement (MERE) mechanism to construct enriched feature views, coupled with a Cascaded Dual-convolution Time-series Attention (CDTA) module for multi-scale temporal representation learning. The proposed MEET-Sepsis framework achieves competitive prediction accuracy using only 20% of the ICU monitoring time required by SOTA methods, significantly advancing early SP. Extensive validation confirms its efficacy.

| **[Towards Identifiability of Hierarchical Temporal Causal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18310v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling hierarchical latent dynamics behind time series data is critical for capturing temporal dependencies across multiple levels of abstraction in real-world tasks. However, existing temporal causal representation learning methods fail to capture such dynamics, as they fail to recover the joint distribution of hierarchical latent variables from \textit{single-timestep observed variables}. Interestingly, we find that the joint distribution of hierarchical latent variables can be uniquely determined using three conditionally independent observations. Building on this insight, we propose a Causally Hierarchical Latent Dynamic (CHiLD) identification framework. Our approach first employs temporal contextual observed variables to identify the joint distribution of multi-layer latent variables. Sequentially, we exploit the natural sparsity of the hierarchical structure among latent variables to identify latent variables within each layer. Guided by the theoretical results, we develop a time series generative model grounded in variational inference. This model incorporates a contextual encoder to reconstruct multi-layer latent variables and normalize flow-based hierarchical prior networks to impose the independent noise condition of hierarchical latent dynamics. Empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate our theoretical claims and demonstrate the effectiveness of CHiLD in modeling hierarchical latent dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Time Series Forecasting with Theoretical Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18281v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper is concerned with online time series forecasting, where unknown distribution shifts occur over time, i.e., latent variables influence the mapping from historical to future observations. To develop an automated way of online time series forecasting, we propose a Theoretical framework for Online Time-series forecasting (TOT in short) with theoretical guarantees. Specifically, we prove that supplying a forecaster with latent variables tightens the Bayes risk, the benefit endures under estimation uncertainty of latent variables and grows as the latent variables achieve a more precise identifiability. To better introduce latent variables into online forecasting algorithms, we further propose to identify latent variables with minimal adjacent observations. Based on these results, we devise a model-agnostic blueprint by employing a temporal decoder to match the distribution of observed variables and two independent noise estimators to model the causal inference of latent variables and mixing procedures of observed variables, respectively. Experiment results on synthetic data support our theoretical claims. Moreover, plug-in implementations built on several baselines yield general improvement across multiple benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Bayesian inference for time series via divide-and-conquer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11043v4)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian computational algorithms tend to scale poorly as data size increases. This has motivated divide-and-conquer-based approaches for scalable inference. These divide the data into subsets, perform inference for each subset in parallel, and then combine these inferences. While appealing theoretical properties and practical performance have been demonstrated for independent observations, scalable inference for dependent data remains challenging. In this work, we study the problem of Bayesian inference from very long time series. The literature in this area focuses mainly on approximate approaches that usually lack rigorous theoretical guarantees and may provide arbitrarily poor accuracy in practice. We propose a simple and scalable divide-and-conquer method, and provide accuracy guarantees. Numerical simulations and real data applications demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProtoTS: Learning Hierarchical Prototypes for Explainable Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23159v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While deep learning has achieved impressive performance in time series forecasting, it becomes increasingly crucial to understand its decision-making process for building trust in high-stakes scenarios. Existing interpretable models often provide only local and partial explanations, lacking the capability to reveal how heterogeneous and interacting input variables jointly shape the overall temporal patterns in the forecast curve. We propose ProtoTS, a novel interpretable forecasting framework that achieves both high accuracy and transparent decision-making through modeling prototypical temporal patterns. ProtoTS computes instance-prototype similarity based on a denoised representation that preserves abundant heterogeneous information. The prototypes are organized hierarchically to capture global temporal patterns with coarse prototypes while capturing finer-grained local variations with detailed prototypes, enabling expert steering and multi-level interpretability. Experiments on multiple realistic benchmarks, including a newly released LOF dataset, show that ProtoTS not only exceeds existing methods in forecast accuracy but also delivers expert-steerable interpretations for better model understanding and decision support.</p></details> | Under submission |

We show that early bed-exit intent can be predicted using only one low-cost load cell mounted under a bed leg. The resulting load signals are first converted into a compact set of complementary images: an RGB line plot that preserves raw waveforms and three texture maps-recurrence plot, Markov transition field, and Gramian angular field-that expose higher-order dynamics. We introduce ViFusionTST, a dual-stream Swin Transformer that processes the line plot and texture maps in parallel and fuses them through cross-attention to learn data-driven modality weights. To provide a realistic benchmark, we collected six months of continuous data from 95 beds in a long-term-care facility. On this real-world dataset ViFusionTST reaches an accuracy of 0.885 and an F1 score of 0.794, surpassing recent 1D and 2D time-series baselines across F1, recall, accuracy, and AUPRC. The results demonstrate that image-based fusion of load-sensor signals for time series classification is a practical and effective solution for real-time, privacy-preserving fall prevention.</p></details> |  |
| **[Centered MA Dirichlet ARMA for Financial Compositions: Theory & Empirical Evidence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18903v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Observation-driven Dirichlet models for compositional time series often use the additive log-ratio (ALR) link and include a moving-average (MA) term built from ALR residuals. In the standard B--DARMA recursion, the usual MA regressor $\alr(\mathbf{Y}_t)-\boldsymbol{\eta}_t$ has nonzero conditional mean under the Dirichlet likelihood, which biases the mean path and blurs the interpretation of MA coefficients. We propose a minimal change: replace the raw regressor with a \emph{centered} innovation $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_t^{\circ}=\alr(\mathbf{Y}_t)-\mathbb{E}\{\alr(\mathbf{Y}_t)\mid \boldsymbol{\eta}_t,\phi_t\}$, computable in closed form via digamma functions. Centering restores mean-zero innovations for the MA block without altering either the likelihood or the ALR link. We provide simple identities for the conditional mean and the forecast recursion, show first-order equivalence to a digamma-link DARMA while retaining a closed-form inverse to $\boldsymbol{\mu}_t$, and give ready-to-use code. A weekly application to the Federal Reserve H.8 bank-asset composition compares the original (raw-MA) and centered specifications under a fixed holdout and rolling one-step origins. The centered formulation improves log predictive scores with essentially identical point error and markedly cleaner Hamiltonian Monte Carlo diagnostics.</p></details> |  |

However, the development of ML-based methods is hindered by the lack of openly available experimental data. To address this gap, we have set up a laboratory-scale batch distillation plant and operated it to generate an extensive experimental database, covering fault-free experiments and experiments in which anomalies were intentionally induced, for training advanced ML-based AD methods. In total, 119 experiments were conducted across a wide range of operating conditions and mixtures. Most experiments containing anomalies were paired with a corresponding fault-free one. The database that we provide here includes time-series data from numerous sensors and actuators, along with estimates of measurement uncertainty. In addition, unconventional data sources -- such as concentration profiles obtained via online benchtop NMR spectroscopy and video and audio recordings -- are provided. Extensive metadata and expert annotations of all experiments are included. The anomaly annotations are based on an ontology developed in this work. The data are organized in a structured database and made freely available via doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17395544. This new database paves the way for the development of advanced ML-based AD methods. As it includes information on the causes of anomalies, it further enables the development of interpretable and explainable ML approaches, as well as methods for anomaly mitigation.</p></details> |  |

We highlight key design considerations for an analysis, including treatment and control group selection, timing of policy adoption, expected effect heterogeneity, and data considerations. We then provide an overview of analytic approaches and differentiate between methods based on evaluation context, such as settings with no control units, a single treated unit, multiple treated units, or with multiple treatment cohorts. Methods discussed include interrupted time series models, difference-in-differences estimators, autoregressive models, and synthetic control methods, along with method extensions which address issues like staggered policy adoption and heterogenous treatment effects. We end with an illustrative example, applying the developed framework to evaluate the impacts of state-level naloxone standing order policies on overdose rates. Overall, we provide researchers with an approach for deciding on methods for state policy evaluations, which can be used to select study designs and inform methodological choices.</p></details> |  |

We show that speech foundation models learn representations that generalize beyond the speech domain and achieve state-of-the-art performance on diverse time-series tasks from wearable sensors. Probes trained on features extracted from HuBERT and wav2vec 2.0 outperform those extracted from self-supervised models trained directly on modality-specific datasets for mood classification, arrhythmia detection, and activity classification tasks. We find that the convolutional feature encoders of speech models are particularly relevant for wearable sensor applications. The proposed approach enhances performance on data-scarce time-series tasks using simple probing methods. This work takes a step toward developing generalized time-series models that unify speech and sensor modalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under review</p></details> |

Forced migration, including refugee and asylum seekers, plays an important role in overall migration patterns, but is notoriously difficult to forecast. Focusing on refugees and asylum seekers, we propose a modeling pipeline based on Bayesian hierarchical time-series modeling for projecting refugee population official statistics by country of origin using data from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Our approach is based on a conceptual model of refugee and asylum seeker populations following growth and decline phases, separated by a peak. The growth and decline phases are modeled by logistic growth and decline through an interrupted logistic process model. We evaluate our method through a set of validation exercises that show it has good performance for forecasts at 1, 5, and 10 year horizons, and we present projections for 35 countries of origin of large refugee and asylum seeker population.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 3 tables, 5 figures</p></details> |

We aim to replicate and capture the complex dynamics of industrial bioprocesses by proposing the use of a Quantum Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (QWGAN-GP) to generate synthetic time series data for industrially relevant processes. The generator within our GAN is comprised of a Parameterized Quantum Circuit (PQC). This methodology offers potential advantages in process monitoring, modeling, forecasting, and optimization, enabling more efficient bioprocess management by reducing the dependence on scarce experimental data. Our results demonstrate acceptable performance in capturing the temporal dynamics of real bioprocess data. We focus on Optical Density, a key measurement for Dry Biomass estimation. The data generated showed high fidelity to the actual historical experimental data. This intersection of quantum computing and machine learning has opened new frontiers in data analysis and generation, particularly in computationally intensive fields, for use cases such as increasing prediction accuracy for soft sensor design or for use in predictive control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Muscle Anatomy-aware Geometric Deep Learning for sEMG-based Gesture Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17660v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust and accurate decoding of gesture from non-invasive surface electromyography (sEMG) is important for various applications including spatial computing, healthcare, and entertainment, and has been actively pursued by researchers and industry. Majority of sEMG-based gesture decoding algorithms employ deep neural networks that are designed for Euclidean data, and may not be suitable for analyzing multi-dimensional, non-stationary time-series with long-range dependencies such as sEMG. State-of-the-art sEMG-based decoding methods also demonstrate high variability across subjects and sessions, requiring re-calibration and adaptive fine-tuning to boost performance. To address these shortcomings, this work proposes a geometric deep learning model that learns on symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifolds and leverages unsupervised domain adaptation to desensitize the model to subjects and sessions. The model captures the features in time and across sensors with multiple kernels, projects the features onto SPD manifold, learns on manifolds and projects back to Euclidean space for classification. It uses a domain-specific batch normalization layer to address variability between sessions, alleviating the need for re-calibration or fine-tuning. Experiments with publicly available benchmark gesture decoding datasets (Ninapro DB6, Flexwear-HD) demonstrate the superior generalizability of the model compared to Euclidean and other SPD-based models in the inter-session scenario, with up to 8.83 and 4.63 points improvement in accuracy, respectively. Detailed analyses reveal that the model extracts muscle-specific information for different tasks and ablation studies highlight the importance of modules introduced in the work. The proposed method pushes the state-of-the-art in sEMG-based gesture recognition and opens new research avenues for manifold-based learning for muscle signals.</p></details> |  |

We propose Parameter--Space Changepoint Detection (Param--CPD), a two--stage framework that first amortizes Bayesian inference of governing parameters with a neural posterior estimator trained by simulation-based inference, and then applies a standard CPD algorithm to the resulting parameter trajectory. On Lorenz--63 with piecewise-constant parameters, Param--CPD improves F1, reduces localization error, and lowers false positives compared to observation--space baselines. We further verify identifiability and calibration of the inferred posteriors on stationary trajectories, explaining why parameter space offers a cleaner detection signal. Robustness analyses over tolerance, window length, and noise indicate consistent gains. Our results show that operating in a physically interpretable parameter space enables accurate and interpretable changepoint detection in nonlinear dynamical systems.</p></details> | 15 pages |

Intuitively, the complex time series can be decomposed into two factors, \ie time-invariant and time-varying components, which indicate static and dynamic patterns, respectively. Nonetheless, existing methods often conflate the time-varying and time-invariant components, and jointly learn the combined long-term patterns and short-term fluctuations, leading to suboptimal performance facing distribution shifts. To address this issue, we initiatively propose a lightweight static-dynamic decomposition framework, TimeEmb, for time series forecasting. TimeEmb innovatively separates time series into two complementary components: (1) time-invariant component, captured by a novel global embedding module that learns persistent representations across time series, and (2) time-varying component, processed by an efficient frequency-domain filtering mechanism inspired by full-spectrum analysis in signal processing. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that TimeEmb outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and requires fewer computational resources. We conduct comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses to verify the efficacy of static-dynamic disentanglement. This lightweight framework can also improve existing time-series forecasting methods with simple integration.

Although many detection methods have been proposed, their performance remains unclear because current metrics capture only narrow aspects of the task and often yield misleading results. We address this issue by introducing verifiable properties that formalize essential requirements for evaluating time-series anomaly detection. These properties enable a theoretical framework that supports principled evaluations and reliable comparisons. Analyzing 37 widely used metrics, we show that most satisfy only a few properties, and none satisfy all, explaining persistent inconsistencies in prior results. To close this gap, we propose LARM, a flexible metric that provably satisfies all properties, and extend it to ALARM, an advanced variant meeting stricter requirements.</p></details> | 73 pages, 13 figures |
| **[A Conditional Diffusion Model for Probabilistic Prediction of Battery Capacity Degradation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17414v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of lithium-ion battery capacity and its associated uncertainty is essential for reliable battery management but remains challenging due to the stochastic nature of aging. This paper presents a novel method, termed the Condition Diffusion U-Net with Attention (CDUA), which integrates feature engineering and deep learning to address this challenge. The proposed approach employs a diffusion-based generative model for time-series forecasting and incorporates attention mechanisms to enhance predictive performance. Battery capacity is first derived from real-world vehicle operation data. The most relevant features are then identified using the Pearson correlation coefficient and the XGBoost algorithm. These features are used to train the CDUA model, which comprises two core components: (1) a contextual U-Net with self-attention to capture complex temporal dependencies, and (2) a denoising network to reconstruct accurate capacity values from noisy observations. Experimental validation on the real-world vehicle data demonstrates that the proposed CDUA model achieves a relative Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.94% and a relative Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.14%, with a narrow 95% confidence interval of 3.74% in relative width. These results confirm that CDUA provides both accurate capacity estimation and reliable uncertainty quantification. Comparative experiments further verify its robustness and superior performance over existing mainstream approaches.</p></details> |  |

Detailed analysis of these dynamics has proven challenging, as conventional methods capture either global trends or local waveform features but rarely their simultaneous interplay at high temporal resolution. To bridge global and local signal analysis, we introduce S4ECG, a novel deep learning architecture leveraging structured state space models for multi-epoch arrhythmia classification. Our joint multi-epoch predictions significantly outperform single-epoch approaches by 1.0-11.6% in macro-AUROC, with atrial fibrillation specificity improving from 0.718-0.979 to 0.967-0.998, demonstrating superior performance in-distribution and enhanced out-of-distribution robustness. Systematic investigation reveals optimal temporal dependency windows spanning 10-20 minutes for peak performance. This work contributes to a paradigm shift toward temporally-aware arrhythmia detection algorithms, opening new possibilities for ECG interpretation, in particular for complex arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.</p></details> |  |

To address these issues, inverse problems focus on reconstructing the original signal from corrupted data by leveraging prior knowledge about its underlying structure. While deep learning methods have demonstrated potential in this domain, they often require extensive pretraining and struggle to generalize under distribution shifts. In this work, we propose RINS-T (Robust Implicit Neural Solvers for Time Series Linear Inverse Problems), a novel deep prior framework that achieves high recovery performance without requiring pretraining data. RINS-T leverages neural networks as implicit priors and integrates robust optimization techniques, making it resilient to outliers while relaxing the reliance on Gaussian noise assumptions. To further improve optimization stability and robustness, we introduce three key innovations: guided input initialization, input perturbation, and convex output combination techniques. Each of these contributions strengthens the framework's optimization stability and robustness. These advancements make RINS-T a flexible and effective solution for addressing complex real-world time series challenges.

This survey offers a structured overview of explainable deep clustering for time series, collecting current methods and their real-world applications. We thoroughly discuss and compare peer-reviewed and preprint papers through application domains across healthcare, finance, IoT, and climate science. Our analysis reveals that most work relies on autoencoder and attention architectures, with limited support for streaming, irregularly sampled, or privacy-preserved series, and interpretability is still primarily treated as an add-on. To push the field forward, we outline six research opportunities: (1) combining complex networks with built-in interpretability; (2) setting up clear, faithfulness-focused evaluation metrics for unsupervised explanations; (3) building explainers that adapt to live data streams; (4) crafting explanations tailored to specific domains; (5) adding human-in-the-loop methods that refine clusters and explanations together; and (6) improving our understanding of how time series clustering models work internally. By making interpretability a primary design goal rather than an afterthought, we propose the groundwork for the next generation of trustworthy deep clustering time series analytics.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, accepted at TempXAI Workshop at ECML-PKDD 2025</p></details> |

Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), as a powerful architecture, though demonstrating effectiveness in NLP, still falls short in adapting to versatile tasks in time series analytics due to its task-agnostic router and the lack of capability in modeling channel correlations. In this study, we propose a novel, general MoE-based time series framework called PatchMoE to support the intricate ``knowledge'' utilization for distinct tasks, thus task-aware. Based on the observation that hierarchical representations often vary across tasks, e.g., forecasting vs. classification, we propose a Recurrent Noisy Gating to utilize the hierarchical information in routing, thus obtaining task-sepcific capability. And the routing strategy is operated on time series tokens in both temporal and channel dimensions, and encouraged by a meticulously designed Temporal \& Channel Load Balancing Loss to model the intricate temporal and channel correlations. Comprehensive experiments on five downstream tasks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of PatchMoE.</p></details> |  |

Recent works focus on building unimodal time series foundation models and end-to-end multimodal supervised models. Since domain-specific knowledge is often contained in modalities like texts, the former lacks the explicit utilization of them, thus hindering the performance. The latter is tailored for end-to-end scenarios and does not support zero-shot inference for cross-domain scenarios. In this work, we introduce Aurora, a Multimodal Time Series Foundation Model, which supports multimodal inputs and zero-shot inference. Pretrained on Corss-domain Multimodal Time Series Corpus, Aurora can adaptively extract and focus on key domain knowledge contained in corrsponding text or image modalities, thus possessing strong Cross-domain generalization capability. Through tokenization, encoding, and distillation, Aurora can extract multimodal domain knowledge as guidance and then utilizes a Modality-Guided Multi-head Self-Attention to inject them into the modeling of temporal representations. In the decoding phase, the multimodal representations are used to generate the conditions and prototypes of future tokens, contributing to a novel Prototype-Guided Flow Matching for generative probabilistic forecasting. Comprehensive experiments on well-recognized benchmarks, including TimeMMD, TSFM-Bench and ProbTS, demonstrate the consistent state-of-the-art performance of Aurora on both unimodal and multimodal scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Time Series Forecasting through Selective Representation Spaces: A Patch Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14510v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Forecasting has made significant progress with the help of Patching technique, which partitions time series into multiple patches to effectively retain contextual semantic information into a representation space beneficial for modeling long-term dependencies. However, conventional patching partitions a time series into adjacent patches, which causes a fixed representation space, thus resulting in insufficiently expressful representations. In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of constructing a selective representation space to flexibly include the most informative patches for forecasting. Specifically, we propose the Selective Representation Space (SRS) module, which utilizes the learnable Selective Patching and Dynamic Reassembly techniques to adaptively select and shuffle the patches from the contextual time series, aiming at fully exploiting the information of contextual time series to enhance the forecasting performance of patch-based models. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SRS module, we propose a simple yet effective SRSNet consisting of SRS and an MLP head, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets from multiple domains. Furthermore, as a novel plugin-and-play module, SRS can also enhance the performance of existing patch-based models. The resources are available at https://github.com/decisionintelligence/SRSNet.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trading with the Devil: Risk and Return in Foundation Model Strategies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17165v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models - already transformative in domains such as natural language processing - are now starting to emerge for time-series tasks in finance. While these pretrained architectures promise versatile predictive signals, little is known about how they shape the risk profiles of the trading strategies built atop them, leaving practitioners reluctant to commit serious capital. In this paper, we propose an extension to the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) that disentangles the systematic risk introduced by a shared foundation model - potentially capable of generating alpha if the underlying model is genuinely predictive - from the idiosyncratic risk attributable to custom fine-tuning, which typically accrues no systematic premium. To enable a practical estimation of these separate risks, we align this decomposition with the concepts of uncertainty disentanglement, casting systematic risk as epistemic uncertainty (rooted in the pretrained model) and idiosyncratic risk as aleatory uncertainty (introduced during custom adaptations). Under the Aleatory Collapse Assumption, we illustrate how Monte Carlo dropout - among other methods in the uncertainty-quantization toolkit - can directly measure the epistemic risk, thereby mapping trading strategies to a more transparent risk-return plane. Our experiments show that isolating these distinct risk factors yields deeper insights into the performance limits of foundation-model-based strategies, their model degradation over time, and potential avenues for targeted refinements. Taken together, our results highlight both the promise and the pitfalls of deploying large pretrained models in competitive financial markets.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Data-Driven Framework for Online Mitigation of False Data Injection Signals in Networked Control Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17155v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel two-stage framework for online mitigation of False Data Injection (FDI) signals to improve the resiliency of Networked Control Systems (NCSs) and ensure their safe operation in the presence of malicious activities. The first stage involves meta learning to select a base time series forecasting model within a stacked ensemble learning architecture. This is achieved by converting time series data into scalograms using continuous wavelet transform, which are then split into image frames to generate a scalo-temporal representation of the data and to distinguish between different complexity levels of time series data based on an entropy metric using a convolutional neural network. In the second stage, the selected model mitigates false data injection signals in real-time. The proposed framework's effectiveness is demonstrated through rigorous simulations involving the formation control of differential drive mobile robots. By addressing the security challenges in NCSs, this framework offers a promising approach to maintaining system integrity and ensuring operational safety.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |

This work demystifies the Transformer encoder by establishing its fundamental equivalence to a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). We show that in the forward pass, the attention distribution matrix serves as a dynamic adjacency matrix, and its composition with subsequent transformations performs computations analogous to graph convolution. Moreover, we demonstrate that in the backward pass, the update dynamics of value and feed-forward projections mirror those of GCN parameters. Building on this unified theoretical reinterpretation, we propose \textbf{Fighter} (Flexible Graph Convolutional Transformer), a streamlined architecture that removes redundant linear projections and incorporates multi-hop graph aggregation. This perspective yields an explicit and interpretable representation of temporal dependencies across different scales, naturally expressed as graph edges. Experiments on standard forecasting benchmarks confirm that Fighter achieves competitive performance while providing clearer mechanistic interpretability of its predictions.</p></details> | Preprint |

This paper presents a BlueSky vision built on two complementary directions. One builds robust foundations for time series reasoning, centered on comprehensive temporal understanding, structured multi-step reasoning, and faithful evaluation frameworks. The other advances system-level reasoning, moving beyond language-only explanations by incorporating multi-agent collaboration, multi-modal context, and retrieval-augmented approaches. Together, these directions outline a flexible and extensible framework for advancing time series reasoning, aiming to deliver interpretable and trustworthy temporal intelligence across diverse domains.</p></details> |  |

By replacing scalar weights with spline-based functional connections and directly parameterizing predictive distributions, P-KANs offer expressive yet parameter-efficient models capable of capturing nonlinear and heavy-tailed dynamics. We evaluate P-KANs on satellite traffic forecasting, where uncertainty-aware predictions enable dynamic thresholding for resource allocation. Results show that P-KANs consistently outperform Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) baselines in both accuracy and calibration, achieving superior efficiency-risk trade-offs while using significantly fewer parameters. We build up P-KANs on two distributions, namely Gaussian and Student-t distributions. The Gaussian variant provides robust, conservative forecasts suitable for safety-critical scenarios, whereas the Student-t variant yields sharper distributions that improve efficiency under stable demand. These findings establish P-KANs as a powerful framework for probabilistic forecasting with direct applicability to satellite communications and other resource-constrained domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[MMformer with Adaptive Transferable Attention: Advancing Multivariate Time Series Forecasting for Environmental Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14050v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Environmental crisis remains a global challenge that affects public health and environmental quality. Despite extensive research, accurately forecasting environmental change trends to inform targeted policies and assess prediction efficiency remains elusive. Conventional methods for multivariate time series (MTS) analysis often fail to capture the complex dynamics of environmental change. To address this, we introduce an innovative meta-learning MTS model, MMformer with Adaptive Transferable Multi-head Attention (ATMA), which combines self-attention and meta-learning for enhanced MTS forecasting. Specifically, MMformer is used to model and predict the time series of seven air quality indicators across 331 cities in China from January 2018 to June 2021 and the time series of precipitation and temperature at 2415 monitoring sites during the summer (276 days) from 2012 to 2014, validating the network's ability to perform and forecast MTS data successfully. Experimental results demonstrate that in these datasets, the MMformer model reaching SOTA outperforms iTransformer, Transformer, and the widely used traditional time series prediction algorithm SARIMAX in the prediction of MTS, reducing by 50\% in MSE, 20\% in MAE as compared to others in air quality datasets, reducing by 20\% in MAPE except SARIMAX. Compared with Transformer and SARIMAX in the climate datasets, MSE, MAE, and MAPE are decreased by 30\%, and there is an improvement compared to iTransformer. This approach represents a significant advance in our ability to forecast and respond to dynamic environmental quality challenges in diverse urban and rural environments. Its predictive capabilities provide valuable public health and environmental quality information, informing targeted interventions.</p></details> |  |

We introduce FreezeTST, a lightweight hybrid that interleaves frozen random-feature (reservoir) blocks with standard trainable Transformer layers. The frozen blocks endow the network with rich nonlinear memory at no optimisation cost; the trainable layers learn to query this memory through self-attention. The design cuts trainable parameters and also lowers wall-clock training time, while leaving inference complexity unchanged. On seven standard long-term forecasting benchmarks, FreezeTST consistently matches or surpasses specialised variants such as Informer, Autoformer, and PatchTST; with substantially lower compute. Our results show that embedding reservoir principles within Transformers offers a simple, principled route to efficient long-term time-series prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 tables, 3 figures, accepted at ECAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Channel Matters: Estimating Channel Influence for Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14763v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The influence function serves as an efficient post-hoc interpretability tool that quantifies the impact of training data modifications on model parameters, enabling enhanced model performance, improved generalization, and interpretability insights without the need for expensive retraining processes. Recently, Multivariate Time Series (MTS) analysis has become an important yet challenging task, attracting significant attention. While channel extremely matters to MTS tasks, channel-centric methods are still largely under-explored for MTS. Particularly, no previous work studied the effects of channel information of MTS in order to explore counterfactual effects between these channels and model performance. To fill this gap, we propose a novel Channel-wise Influence (ChInf) method that is the first to estimate the influence of different channels in MTS. Based on ChInf,we naturally derived two channel-wise algorithms by incorporating ChInf into classic MTS tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ChInf and ChInf-based methods in critical MTS analysis tasks, such as MTS anomaly detection and MTS data pruning. Specifically, our ChInf-based methods rank top-1 among all methods for comparison, while previous influence functions do not perform well on MTS anomaly detection tasks and MTS data pruning problem. This fully supports the superiority and necessity of ChInf.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Neurips 2025</p></details> |

We introduce a functional Nadaraya-Watson estimator that combines the signature transform from rough path theory with local kernel regression. The signature transform provides a principled way to encode sequential data through iterated integrals, enabling direct comparison of paths in a natural metric space. Our approach leverages signature-induced distances within the classical kernel regression framework, achieving computational efficiency while avoiding the scalability bottlenecks of large-scale kernel matrix operations. We establish finite-sample convergence bounds demonstrating favorable statistical properties of signature-based distances compared to traditional metrics in infinite-dimensional settings. We propose robust signature variants that provide stability against outliers, enhancing practical performance. Applications to both synthetic and real-world data - including stochastic differential equation learning and time series classification - demonstrate competitive accuracy while offering significant computational advantages over existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Resolution-Aware Retrieval Augmented Zero-Shot Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16695v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot forecasting aims to predict outcomes for previously unseen conditions without direct historical data, posing a significant challenge for traditional forecasting methods. We introduce a Resolution-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Forecasting model that enhances predictive accuracy by leveraging spatial correlations and temporal frequency characteristics. By decomposing signals into different frequency components, our model employs resolution-aware retrieval, where lower-frequency components rely on broader spatial context, while higher-frequency components focus on local influences. This allows the model to dynamically retrieve relevant data and adapt to new locations with minimal historical context. Applied to microclimate forecasting, our model significantly outperforms traditional forecasting methods, numerical weather prediction models, and modern foundation time series models, achieving 71% lower MSE than HRRR and 34% lower MSE than Chronos on the ERA5 dataset. Our results highlight the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented and resolution-aware strategies, offering a scalable and data-efficient solution for zero-shot forecasting in microclimate modeling and beyond.</p></details> |  |

Two tasks are studied under record-level, non-overlapping splits: near-term tachycardia risk (next ten seconds) and one-step heart rate forecasting. We compare a GRU-D (RNN) and a Transformer under matched training budgets against strong non-learned baselines. Evaluation is calibration-aware for classification and proper for forecasting, with temperature scaling and grouped bootstrap confidence intervals. On MIT-BIH, GRU-D slightly surpasses the Transformer for tachycardia risk, while the Transformer clearly lowers forecasting error relative to GRU-D and persistence. Our results show that, in longitudinal monitoring, model choice is task-dependent: compact RNNs remain competitive for short-horizon risk scoring, whereas compact Transformers deliver clearer gains for point forecasting.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce the forecasting problem from textual time series, where timestamped clinical findings -- extracted via an LLM-assisted annotation pipeline -- serve as the primary input for prediction. We systematically evaluate a diverse suite of models, including fine-tuned decoder-based large language models and encoder-based transformers, on tasks of event occurrence prediction, temporal ordering, and survival analysis. Our experiments reveal that encoder-based models consistently achieve higher F1 scores and superior temporal concordance for short- and long-horizon event forecasting, while fine-tuned masking approaches enhance ranking performance. In contrast, instruction-tuned decoder models demonstrate a relative advantage in survival analysis, especially in early prognosis settings. Our sensitivity analyses further demonstrate the importance of time ordering, which requires clinical time series construction, as compared to text ordering, the format of the text inputs that LLMs are classically trained on. This highlights the additional benefit that can be ascertained from time-ordered corpora, with implications for temporal tasks in the era of widespread LLM use.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI AI for Social Impact 2026.

| **[Structured Temporal Causality for Interpretable Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16511v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world multivariate time series anomalies are rare and often unlabeled. Additionally, prevailing methods rely on increasingly complex architectures tuned to benchmarks, detecting only fragments of anomalous segments and overstating performance. In this paper, we introduce OracleAD, a simple and interpretable unsupervised framework for multivariate time series anomaly detection. OracleAD encodes each variable's past sequence into a single causal embedding to jointly predict the present time point and reconstruct the input window, effectively modeling temporal dynamics. These embeddings then undergo a self-attention mechanism to project them into a shared latent space and capture spatial relationships. These relationships are not static, since they are modeled by a property that emerges from each variable's temporal dynamics. The projected embeddings are aligned to a Stable Latent Structure (SLS) representing normal-state relationships. Anomalies are identified using a dual scoring mechanism based on prediction error and deviation from the SLS, enabling fine-grained anomaly diagnosis at each time point and across individual variables. Since any noticeable SLS deviation originates from embeddings that violate the learned temporal causality of normal data, OracleAD directly pinpoints the root-cause variables at the embedding level. OracleAD achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple real-world datasets and evaluation protocols, while remaining interpretable through SLS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

The key to building a logically centralized but physically distributed control-plane is running diverse cluster management protocols to achieve consistency through an exchange of control traffic. Meanwhile, we observe that the control traffic exposes unique time-series patterns and directional relationships due to the operational structure even though the traffic is encrypted, and this pattern can disclose confidential information such as control-plane topology and protocol dependencies, which can be exploited for severe attacks. With this insight, we propose a new SD-WAN fingerprinting system, called Heimdallr. It analyzes periodical and operational patterns of SD-WAN cluster management protocols and the context of flow directions from the collected control traffic utilizing a deep learning-based approach, so that it can classify the cluster management protocols automatically from miscellaneous control traffic datasets. Our evaluation, which is performed in a realistic SD-WAN environment consisting of geographically distant three campus networks and one enterprise network shows that Heimdallr can classify SD-WAN control traffic with $\geq$ 93%, identify individual protocols with $\geq$ 80% macro F-1 scores, and finally can infer control-plane topology with $\geq$ 70% similarity.</p></details> | 14 pages, 14 figures |

However, the accuracy of such methods is constrained by three key challenges: inadequate extraction of fine-grained temporal patterns, suboptimal integration of multimodal information, and limited adaptability to dynamic multi-scale features. To address these problems, we propose MGTS-Net, a Multimodal Graph-enhanced Network for Time Series forecasting. The model consists of three core components: (1) a Multimodal Feature Extraction layer (MFE), which optimizes feature encoders according to the characteristics of temporal, visual, and textual modalities to extract temporal features of fine-grained patterns; (2) a Multimodal Feature Fusion layer (MFF), which constructs a heterogeneous graph to model intra-modal temporal dependencies and cross-modal alignment relationships and dynamically aggregates multimodal knowledge; (3) a Multi-Scale Prediction layer (MSP), which adapts to multi-scale features by dynamically weighting and fusing the outputs of short-term, medium-term, and long-term predictors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGTS-Net exhibits excellent performance with light weight and high efficiency. Compared with other state-of-the-art baseline models, our method achieves superior performance, validating the superiority of the proposed methodology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predictability of Complex Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16312v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The study of complex systems has attracted widespread attention from researchers in the fields of natural sciences, social sciences, and engineering. Prediction is one of the central issues in this field. Although most related studies have focused on prediction methods, research on the predictability of complex systems has received increasing attention across disciplines--aiming to provide theories and tools to address a key question: What are the limits of prediction accuracy? Predictability itself can serve as an important feature for characterizing complex systems, and accurate estimation of predictability can provide a benchmark for the study of prediction algorithms. This allows researchers to clearly identify the gap between current prediction accuracy and theoretical limits, thereby helping them determine whether there is still significant room to improve existing algorithms. More importantly, investigating predictability often requires the development of new theories and methods, which can further inspire the design of more effective algorithms. Over the past few decades, this field has undergone significant evolution. In particular, the rapid development of data science has introduced a wealth of data-driven approaches for understanding and quantifying predictability. This review summarizes representative achievements, integrating both data-driven and mechanistic perspectives. After a brief introduction to the significance of the topic in focus, we will explore three core aspects: the predictability of time series, the predictability of network structures, and the predictability of dynamical processes. Finally, we will provide extensive application examples across various fields and outline open challenges for future research.</p></details> |  |

An Empirical Study on Two-Million Preprints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17882v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preprint repositories become central infrastructures for scholarly communication. Their expansion transforms how research is circulated and evaluated before journal publication. Generative large language models (LLMs) introduce a further potential disruption by altering how manuscripts are written. While speculation abounds, systematic evidence of whether and how LLMs reshape scientific publishing remains limited. This paper addresses the gap through a large-scale analysis of more than 2.1 million preprints spanning 2016--2025 (115 months) across four major repositories (i.e., arXiv, bioRxiv, medRxiv, SocArXiv). We introduce a multi-level analytical framework that integrates interrupted time-series models, collaboration and productivity metrics, linguistic profiling, and topic modeling to assess changes in volume, authorship, style, and disciplinary orientation. Our findings reveal that LLMs have accelerated submission and revision cycles, modestly increased linguistic complexity, and disproportionately expanded AI-related topics, while computationally intensive fields benefit more than others. These results show that LLMs act less as universal disruptors than as selective catalysts, amplifying existing strengths and widening disciplinary divides. By documenting these dynamics, the paper provides the first empirical foundation for evaluating the influence of generative AI on academic publishing and highlights the need for governance frameworks that preserve trust, fairness, and accountability in an AI-enabled research ecosystem.</p></details> |  |

We introduce GEM, the first MLLM unifying ECG time series, 12-lead ECG images and text for grounded and clinician-aligned ECG interpretation. GEM enables feature-grounded analysis, evidence-driven reasoning, and a clinician-like diagnostic process through three core innovations: a dual-encoder framework extracting complementary time series and image features, cross-modal alignment for effective multimodal understanding, and knowledge-guided instruction generation for generating high-granularity grounding data (ECG-Grounding) linking diagnoses to measurable parameters ($e.g.$, QRS/PR Intervals). Additionally, we propose the Grounded ECG Understanding task, a clinically motivated benchmark designed to comprehensively assess the MLLM's capability in grounded ECG understanding. Experimental results on both existing and our proposed benchmarks show GEM significantly improves predictive performance (CSN $7.4\% \uparrow$), explainability ($22.7\% \uparrow$), and grounding ($24.8\% \uparrow$), making it more suitable for real-world clinical applications.

However, many applications require strong properties besides valid inference, such as privacy, robustness or validity under continuous distribution shifts; deriving prediction-powered methods with such guarantees is generally an arduous process, and has to be done case by case. In this paper, we resolve this issue by connecting prediction-powered inference with conformal prediction: by performing imputation through a calibrated conformal set-predictor, we attain validity while achieving additional guarantees in a natural manner. We instantiate our procedure for the inference of means, Z- and M-estimation, as well as e-values and e-value-based procedures. Furthermore, in the case of e-values, ours is the first general prediction-powered procedure that operates off-line. We demonstrate these advantages by applying our method on private and time-series data. Both tasks are nontrivial within the standard prediction-powered framework but become natural under our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Still Competitive: Revisiting Recurrent Models for Irregular Time Series Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16161v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling irregularly sampled multivariate time series is a persistent challenge in domains like healthcare and sensor networks. While recent works have explored a variety of complex learning architectures to solve the prediction problems for irregularly sampled time series, it remains unclear what are the true benefits of some of these architectures, and whether clever modifications of simpler and more efficient RNN-based algorithms are still competitive, i.e. they are on par with or even superior to these methods. In this work, we propose and study GRUwE: Gated Recurrent Unit with Exponential basis functions, that builds upon RNN-based architectures for observations made at irregular times. GRUwE supports both regression-based and event-based predictions in continuous time. GRUwE works by maintaining a Markov state representation of the time series that updates with the arrival of irregular observations. The Markov state update relies on two reset mechanisms: (i) observation-triggered reset, and (ii) time-triggered reset of the GRU state using learnable exponential decays, to support the predictions in continuous time. Our empirical evaluations across several real-world benchmarks on next-observation and next-event prediction tasks demonstrate that GRUwE can indeed achieve competitive to superior performance compared to the recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Thanks to its simplicity, GRUwE offers compelling advantages: it is easy to implement, requires minimal hyper-parameter tuning efforts, and significantly reduces the computational overhead in the online deployment.</p></details> |  |

We present a Bayesian Dirichlet ARMA (BDARMA) model for monthly shares of hydro, geothermal, solar, wind, wood, municipal waste, and biofuels from January 2010 to January 2025. The mean vector follows a parsimonious VAR(2) in additive-log-ratio space, while the Dirichlet concentration parameter combines an intercept with ten Fourier harmonics, letting predictive dispersion expand or contract with the seasons. A 61-split rolling-origin study generates twelve-month density forecasts from January 2019 to January 2024. Relative to three benchmarks, a Gaussian VAR(2) in transform space, a seasonal naive copy of last year's proportions, and a drift-free additive-log-ratio random walk, BDARMA lowers the mean continuous ranked probability score by fifteen to sixty percent, achieves component-wise ninety percent interval coverage close to nominal, and matches Gaussian VAR point accuracy through eight months with a maximum loss of 0.02 Aitchison units thereafter. BDARMA therefore delivers sharp, well-calibrated probabilistic forecasts of multivariate renewable-energy shares without sacrificing point precision.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches largely focus on univariate forecasting, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios where multivariate data and covariates play a crucial role. We present Chronos-2, a pretrained model capable of handling univariate, multivariate, and covariate-informed forecasting tasks in a zero-shot manner. Chronos-2 employs a group attention mechanism that facilitates in-context learning (ICL) through efficient information sharing across multiple time series within a group, which may represent sets of related series, variates of a multivariate series, or targets and covariates in a forecasting task. These general capabilities are achieved through training on synthetic datasets that impose diverse multivariate structures on univariate series. Chronos-2 delivers state-of-the-art performance across three comprehensive benchmarks: fev-bench, GIFT-Eval, and Chronos Benchmark II. On fev-bench, which emphasizes multivariate and covariate-informed forecasting, Chronos-2's universal ICL capabilities lead to substantial improvements over existing models. On tasks involving covariates, it consistently outperforms baselines by a wide margin. Case studies in the energy and retail domains further highlight its practical advantages. The in-context learning capabilities of Chronos-2 establish it as a general-purpose forecasting model that can be used "as is" in real-world forecasting pipelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[A nonstationary seasonal Dynamic Factor Model: an application to temperature time series from the state of Minas Gerais](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15667v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many scientific fields, such as agriculture, temperature time series are of interest both as explanatory variables and as objects of study in their own right. However, at the state level, incorporating information from all possible locations in an analysis can be overwhelming, while using a summary measure, such as the state-wide average temperature, can result in significant information loss. In this context, using Dynamic Factor Models (DFMs) provides a compelling alternative for analyzing such multivariate time series, as they allow for the extraction of a small number of common factors that capture the majority of the variability in the data. Given that temperature series are typically seasonal, this study applies a nonstationary seasonal DFM to analyze a multivariate temperature time series from the state of Minas Gerais. The results show that the data can be effectively represented by two seasonal factors: the first captures the general seasonal pattern of the state, while the second contrasts the months of highest annual temperatures between two distinct regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper presented on the XVII MGEST (Lavras, Brazil - 2025)</p></details> |
| **[TokenTiming: A Dynamic Alignment Method for Universal Speculative Decoding Model Pairs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15545v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accelerating the inference of large language models (LLMs) has been a critical challenge in generative AI. Speculative decoding (SD) substantially improves LLM inference efficiency. However, its utility is limited by a fundamental constraint: the draft and target models must share the same vocabulary, thus limiting the herd of available draft models and often necessitating the training of a new model from scratch. Inspired by Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a classic algorithm for aligning time series, we propose the algorithm TokenTiming for universal speculative decoding. It operates by re-encoding the draft token sequence to get a new target token sequence, and then uses DTW to build a mapping to transfer the probability distributions for speculative sampling. Benefiting from this, our method accommodates mismatched vocabularies and works with any off-the-shelf models without retraining and modification. We conduct comprehensive experiments on various tasks, demonstrating 1.57x speedup. This work enables a universal approach for draft model selection, making SD a more versatile and practical tool for LLM acceleration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Nonstationarity in Time Series: A Deterministic Trend Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07987v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper challenges the dominance of stochastic trend models by introducing the Seasonal-Trend-Stationary ARMA (STSA) framework, which models univariate nonstationary time series as stationary fluctuations around deterministic trend and seasonal components, incorporating a finite number of structural breaks. We propose methods for estimating the locations and numbers of breaks using a modified dynamic programming algorithm and a sequential prediction-interval procedure, and we outline strategies for specifying and estimating the full model. Empirical analysis of U.S. Retail Sales (2004-2025) shows that the STSA model accurately identifies structural breaks corresponding to major economic events, including the Global Financial Crisis and the COVID-19 downturn. The decomposition into trend, seasonal, and ARMA components provides a realistic and interpretable representation of the underlying dynamics of the economic cycle, offering insights into the pace of growth within each regime, recurring seasonal patterns, and the persistence of short-term fluctuations. Although designed primarily for interpretability, STSA substantially outperforms Prophet and achieves forecasting accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art stochastic trend models (ARIMA, ETS, TBATS, Theta) on the M4 Competition monthly dataset, with particular advantages for series exhibiting abrupt structural changes, where stochastic models typically struggle to adapt.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Kernel Dynamic Mode Decomposition for Streaming Time Series Forecasting with Adaptive Windowing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15404v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time forecasting from streaming data poses critical challenges: handling non-stationary dynamics, operating under strict computational limits, and adapting rapidly without catastrophic forgetting. However, many existing approaches face trade-offs between accuracy, adaptability, and efficiency, particularly when deployed in constrained computing environments. We introduce WORK-DMD (Windowed Online Random Kernel Dynamic Mode Decomposition), a method that combines Random Fourier Features with online Dynamic Mode Decomposition to capture nonlinear dynamics through explicit feature mapping, while preserving fixed computational cost and competitive predictive accuracy across evolving data. WORK-DMD employs Sherman-Morrison updates within rolling windows, enabling continuous adaptation to evolving dynamics from only current data, eliminating the need for lengthy training or large storage requirements for historical data. Experiments on benchmark datasets across several domains show that WORK-DMD achieves higher accuracy than several state-of-the-art online forecasting methods, while requiring only a single pass through the data and demonstrating particularly strong performance in short-term forecasting. Our results show that combining kernel evaluations with adaptive matrix updates achieves strong predictive performance with minimal data requirements. This sample efficiency offers a practical alternative to deep learning for streaming forecasting applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonparametric Testing of Spatial Dependence in 2D and 3D Random Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15381v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a flexible and robust nonparametric framework for testing spatial dependence in two- and three-dimensional random fields. Our approach involves converting spatial data into one-dimensional time series using space-filling Hilbert curves. We then apply ordinal pattern-based tests for serial dependence to this series. Because Hilbert curves preserve spatial locality, spatial dependence in the original field manifests as serial dependence in the transformed sequence. The approach is easy to implement, accommodates arbitrary grid sizes through generalized Hilbert (``gilbert'') curves, and naturally extends beyond three dimensions. This provides a practical and general alternative to existing methods based on spatial ordinal patterns, which are typically limited to two-dimensional settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sequence Modeling with Spectral Mean Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15366v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A key question in sequence modeling with neural networks is how to represent and learn highly nonlinear and probabilistic state dynamics. Operator theory views such dynamics as linear maps on Hilbert spaces containing mean embedding vectors of distributions, offering an appealing but currently overlooked perspective. We propose a new approach to sequence modeling based on an operator-theoretic view of a hidden Markov model (HMM). Instead of materializing stochastic recurrence, we embed the full sequence distribution as a tensor in the product Hilbert space. A generative process is then defined as maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) gradient flow in the space of sequences. To overcome challenges with large tensors and slow sampling convergence, we introduce spectral mean flows, a novel tractable algorithm integrating two core concepts. First, we propose a new neural architecture by leveraging spectral decomposition of linear operators to derive a scalable tensor network decomposition of sequence mean embeddings. Second, we extend MMD gradient flows to time-dependent Hilbert spaces and connect them to flow matching via the continuity equation, enabling simulation-free learning and faster sampling. We demonstrate competitive results on a range of time-series modeling datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/jw9730/spectral-mean-flow.</p></details> | 30 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Causal Time Series Modeling of Supraglacial Lake Evolution in Greenland under Distribution Shift](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15265v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal modeling offers a principled foundation for uncovering stable, invariant relationships in time-series data, thereby improving robustness and generalization under distribution shifts. Yet its potential is underutilized in spatiotemporal Earth observation, where models often depend on purely correlational features that fail to transfer across heterogeneous domains. We propose RIC-TSC, a regionally-informed causal time-series classification framework that embeds lag-aware causal discovery directly into sequence modeling, enabling both predictive accuracy and scientific interpretability. Using multi-modal satellite and reanalysis data-including Sentinel-1 microwave backscatter, Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 optical reflectance, and CARRA meteorological variables-we leverage Joint PCMCI+ (J-PCMCI+) to identify region-specific and invariant predictors of supraglacial lake evolution in Greenland. Causal graphs are estimated globally and per basin, with validated predictors and their time lags supplied to lightweight classifiers. On a balanced benchmark of 1000 manually labeled lakes from two contrasting melt seasons (2018-2019), causal models achieve up to 12.59% higher accuracy than correlation-based baselines under out-of-distribution evaluation. These results show that causal discovery is not only a means of feature selection but also a pathway to generalizable and mechanistically grounded models of dynamic Earth surface processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as full paper in ICMLA 2025 (Special Session 1: Deep Learning and Applications)</p></details> |
| **[Recursive Gaussian Process State Space Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14679v4)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning dynamical models from data is not only fundamental but also holds great promise for advancing principle discovery, time-series prediction, and controller design. Among various approaches, Gaussian Process State-Space Models (GPSSMs) have recently gained significant attention due to their combination of flexibility and interpretability. However, for online learning, the field lacks an efficient method suitable for scenarios where prior information regarding data distribution and model function is limited. To address this issue, this paper proposes a recursive GPSSM method with adaptive capabilities for both operating domains and Gaussian process (GP) hyperparameters. Specifically, we first utilize first-order linearization to derive a Bayesian update equation for the joint distribution between the system state and the GP model, enabling closed-form and domain-independent learning. Second, an online selection algorithm for inducing points is developed based on informative criteria to achieve lightweight learning. Third, to support online hyperparameter optimization, we recover historical measurement information from the current filtering distribution. Comprehensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior accuracy, computational efficiency, and adaptability of our method compared to state-of-the-art online GPSSM techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Accuracy: Are Time Series Foundation Models Well-Calibrated?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16060v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development of foundation models for time series data has generated considerable interest in using such models across a variety of applications. Although foundation models achieve state-of-the-art predictive performance, their calibration properties remain relatively underexplored, despite the fact that calibration can be critical for many practical applications. In this paper, we investigate the calibration-related properties of five recent time series foundation models and two competitive baselines. We perform a series of systematic evaluations assessing model calibration (i.e., over- or under-confidence), effects of varying prediction heads, and calibration under long-term autoregressive forecasting. We find that time series foundation models are consistently better calibrated than baseline models and tend not to be either systematically over- or under-confident, in contrast to the overconfidence often seen in other deep learning models.</p></details> |  |
