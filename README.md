| **[The broader spectrum of in-context learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03782v3)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability of language models to learn a task from a few examples in context has generated substantial interest. Here, we provide a perspective that situates this type of supervised few-shot learning within a much broader spectrum of meta-learned in-context learning. Indeed, we suggest that any distribution of sequences in which context non-trivially decreases loss on subsequent predictions can be interpreted as eliciting a kind of in-context learning. We suggest that this perspective helps to unify the broad set of in-context abilities that language models exhibit -- such as adapting to tasks from instructions or role play, or extrapolating time series. This perspective also sheds light on potential roots of in-context learning in lower-level processing of linguistic dependencies (e.g. coreference or parallel structures). Finally, taking this perspective highlights the importance of generalization, which we suggest can be studied along several dimensions: not only the ability to learn something novel, but also flexibility in learning from different presentations, and in applying what is learned. We discuss broader connections to past literature in meta-learning and goal-conditioned agents, and other perspectives on learning and adaptation. We close by suggesting that research on in-context learning should consider this broader spectrum of in-context capabilities and types of generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Beyond Experience: Generalizing to Unseen State Space with Reservoir Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05292v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning techniques offer an effective approach to modeling dynamical systems solely from observed data. However, without explicit structural priors -- built-in assumptions about the underlying dynamics -- these techniques typically struggle to generalize to aspects of the dynamics that are poorly represented in the training data. Here, we demonstrate that reservoir computing -- a simple, efficient, and versatile machine learning framework often used for data-driven modeling of dynamical systems -- can generalize to unexplored regions of state space without explicit structural priors. First, we describe a multiple-trajectory training scheme for reservoir computers that supports training across a collection of disjoint time series, enabling effective use of available training data. Then, applying this training scheme to multistable dynamical systems, we show that RCs trained on trajectories from a single basin of attraction can achieve out-of-domain generalization by capturing system behavior in entirely unobserved basins.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |
| **[How to Unlock Time Series Editing? Diffusion-Driven Approach with Multi-Grained Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05276v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in time series generation have shown promise, yet controlling properties in generated sequences remains challenging. Time Series Editing (TSE) - making precise modifications while preserving temporal coherence - consider both point-level constraints and segment-level controls that current methods struggle to provide. We introduce the CocktailEdit framework to enable simultaneous, flexible control across different types of constraints. This framework combines two key mechanisms: a confidence-weighted anchor control for point-wise constraints and a classifier-based control for managing statistical properties such as sums and averages over segments. Our methods achieve precise local control during the denoising inference stage while maintaining temporal coherence and integrating seamlessly, with any conditionally trained diffusion-based time series models. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and models demonstrate its effectiveness. Our work bridges the gap between pure generative modeling and real-world time series editing needs, offering a flexible solution for human-in-the-loop time series generation and editing. The code and demo are provided for validation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context is Key: A Benchmark for Forecasting with Essential Textual Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18959v4)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting is a critical task in decision-making across numerous domains. While historical numerical data provide a start, they fail to convey the complete context for reliable and accurate predictions. Human forecasters frequently rely on additional information, such as background knowledge and constraints, which can efficiently be communicated through natural language. However, in spite of recent progress with LLM-based forecasters, their ability to effectively integrate this textual information remains an open question. To address this, we introduce "Context is Key" (CiK), a time-series forecasting benchmark that pairs numerical data with diverse types of carefully crafted textual context, requiring models to integrate both modalities; crucially, every task in CiK requires understanding textual context to be solved successfully. We evaluate a range of approaches, including statistical models, time series foundation models, and LLM-based forecasters, and propose a simple yet effective LLM prompting method that outperforms all other tested methods on our benchmark. Our experiments highlight the importance of incorporating contextual information, demonstrate surprising performance when using LLM-based forecasting models, and also reveal some of their critical shortcomings. This benchmark aims to advance multimodal forecasting by promoting models that are both accurate and accessible to decision-makers with varied technical expertise.

| **[Learning long range dependencies through time reversal symmetry breaking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05259v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep State Space Models (SSMs) reignite physics-grounded compute paradigms, as RNNs could natively be embodied into dynamical systems. This calls for dedicated learning algorithms obeying to core physical principles, with efficient techniques to simulate these systems and guide their design. We propose Recurrent Hamiltonian Echo Learning (RHEL), an algorithm which provably computes loss gradients as finite differences of physical trajectories of non-dissipative, Hamiltonian systems. In ML terms, RHEL only requires three "forward passes" irrespective of model size, without explicit Jacobian computation, nor incurring any variance in the gradient estimation. Motivated by the physical realization of our algorithm, we first introduce RHEL in continuous time and demonstrate its formal equivalence with the continuous adjoint state method. To facilitate the simulation of Hamiltonian systems trained by RHEL, we propose a discrete-time version of RHEL which is equivalent to Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) when applied to a class of recurrent modules which we call Hamiltonian Recurrent Units (HRUs). This setting allows us to demonstrate the scalability of RHEL by generalizing these results to hierarchies of HRUs, which we call Hamiltonian SSMs (HSSMs). We apply RHEL to train HSSMs with linear and nonlinear dynamics on a variety of time-series tasks ranging from mid-range to long-range classification and regression with sequence length reaching $\sim 50k$. We show that RHEL consistently matches the performance of BPTT across all models and tasks. This work opens new doors for the design of scalable, energy-efficient physical systems endowed with self-learning capabilities for sequence modelling.</p></details> | 45 pages |
| **[Robust Moment Identification for Nonlinear PDEs via a Neural ODE Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05245v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a data-driven framework for learning reduced-order moment dynamics from PDE-governed systems using Neural ODEs. In contrast to derivative-based methods like SINDy, which necessitate densely sampled data and are sensitive to noise, our approach based on Neural ODEs directly models moment trajectories, enabling robust learning from sparse and potentially irregular time series. Using as an application platform the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation, the framework accurately recovers governing moment dynamics when closure is available, even with limited and irregular observations. For systems without analytical closure, we introduce a data-driven coordinate transformation strategy based on Stiefel manifold optimization, enabling the discovery of low-dimensional representations in which the moment dynamics become closed, facilitating interpretable and reliable modeling. We also explore cases where a closure model is not known, such as a Fisher-KPP reaction-diffusion system. Here we demonstrate that Neural ODEs can still effectively approximate the unclosed moment dynamics and achieve superior extrapolation accuracy compared to physical-expert-derived ODE models. This advantage remains robust even under sparse and irregular sampling, highlighting the method's robustness in data-limited settings. Our results highlight the Neural ODE framework as a powerful and flexible tool for learning interpretable, low-dimensional moment dynamics in complex PDE-governed systems.</p></details> |  |
