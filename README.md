| **[An Empirical Bayes approach to ARX Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13384v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Empirical Bayes inference is based on estimation of the parameters of an a priori distribution from the observed data. The estimation technique of the parameters of the prior, called hyperparameters, is based on the marginal distribution obtained by integrating the joint density of the model with respect to the prior. This is a key step which needs to be properly adapted to the problem at hand. In this paper we study Empirical Bayes inference of linear autoregressive models with inputs (ARX models) for time series and compare the performance of the marginal parametric estimator with that a full Empirical Bayesian analysis based on the estimated prior. Such a comparison, can only make sense for a (realistic) finite data length. In this setting, we propose a new estimation technique of the hyperparameters by a sequential Bayes procedure which is essentially a backward Kalman filter. It turns out that for finite data length the marginal Bayes tends to behave slightly better than the full Empirical Bayesian parameter estimator and so also in the case of slowly varying random parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeSeriesGym: A Scalable Benchmark for (Time Series) Machine Learning Engineering Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13291v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce TimeSeriesGym, a scalable benchmarking framework for evaluating Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents on time series machine learning engineering challenges. Existing benchmarks lack scalability, focus narrowly on model building in well-defined settings, and evaluate only a limited set of research artifacts (e.g., CSV submission files). To make AI agent benchmarking more relevant to the practice of machine learning engineering, our framework scales along two critical dimensions. First, recognizing that effective ML engineering requires a range of diverse skills, TimeSeriesGym incorporates challenges from diverse sources spanning multiple domains and tasks. We design challenges to evaluate both isolated capabilities (including data handling, understanding research repositories, and code translation) and their combinations, and rather than addressing each challenge independently, we develop tools that support designing multiple challenges at scale. Second, we implement evaluation mechanisms for multiple research artifacts, including submission files, code, and models, using both precise numeric measures and more flexible LLM-based evaluation approaches. This dual strategy balances objective assessment with contextual judgment. Although our initial focus is on time series applications, our framework can be readily extended to other data modalities, broadly enhancing the comprehensiveness and practical utility of agentic AI evaluation. We open-source our benchmarking framework to facilitate future research on the ML engineering capabilities of AI agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Open ...</summary><p>Open source code available at https://github.com/moment-timeseries-foundation-model/TimeSeriesGym.

| **[Level Generation with Quantum Reservoir Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13287v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reservoir computing is a form of machine learning particularly suited for time series analysis, including forecasting predictions. We take an implementation of \emph{quantum} reservoir computing that was initially designed to generate variants of musical scores and adapt it to create levels of Super Mario Bros. Motivated by our analysis of these levels, we develop a new Roblox \textit{obby} where the courses can be generated in real time on superconducting qubit hardware, and investigate some of the constraints placed by such real-time generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Performance of Zero-Shot Time Series Foundation Models on Cloud Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12944v3)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series foundation models (FMs) have emerged as a popular paradigm for zero-shot multi-domain forecasting. FMs are trained on numerous diverse datasets and claim to be effective forecasters across multiple different time series domains, including cloud data. In this work we investigate this claim, exploring the effectiveness of FMs on cloud data. We demonstrate that many well-known FMs fail to generate meaningful or accurate zero-shot forecasts in this setting. We support this claim empirically, showing that FMs are outperformed consistently by simple linear baselines. We also illustrate a number of interesting pathologies, including instances where FMs suddenly output seemingly erratic, random-looking forecasts. Our results suggest a widespread failure of FMs to model cloud data.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, presented at the "I Can't Believe It's Not Better" workshop at ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[True Zero-Shot Inference of Dynamical Systems Preserving Long-Term Statistics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13192v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex, temporally evolving phenomena, from climate to brain activity, are governed by dynamical systems (DS). DS reconstruction (DSR) seeks to infer generative surrogate models of these from observed data, reproducing their long-term behavior. Existing DSR approaches require purpose-training for any new system observed, lacking the zero-shot and in-context inference capabilities known from LLMs. Here we introduce DynaMix, a novel multivariate ALRNN-based mixture-of-experts architecture pre-trained for DSR, the first DSR model able to generalize zero-shot to out-of-domain DS. Just from a provided context signal, without any re-training, DynaMix faithfully forecasts the long-term evolution of novel DS where existing time series (TS) foundation models, like Chronos, fail -- at a fraction of the number of parameters and orders of magnitude faster inference times. DynaMix outperforms TS foundation models in terms of long-term statistics, and often also short-term forecasts, even on real-world time series, like traffic or weather data, typically used for training and evaluating TS models, but not at all part of DynaMix' training corpus. We illustrate some of the failure modes of TS models for DSR problems, and conclude that models built on DS principles may bear a huge potential also for advancing the TS prediction field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing LLMs for Time Series Forecasting via Structure-Guided Cross-Modal Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13175v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emerging paradigm of leveraging pretrained large language models (LLMs) for time series forecasting has predominantly employed linguistic-temporal modality alignment strategies through token-level or layer-wise feature mapping. However, these approaches fundamentally neglect a critical insight: the core competency of LLMs resides not merely in processing localized token features but in their inherent capacity to model holistic sequence structures. This paper posits that effective cross-modal alignment necessitates structural consistency at the sequence level. We propose the Structure-Guided Cross-Modal Alignment (SGCMA), a framework that fully exploits and aligns the state-transition graph structures shared by time-series and linguistic data as sequential modalities, thereby endowing time series with language-like properties and delivering stronger generalization after modality alignment. SGCMA consists of two key components, namely Structure Alignment and Semantic Alignment. In Structure Alignment, a state transition matrix is learned from text data through Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), and a shallow transformer-based Maximum Entropy Markov Model (MEMM) receives the hot-start transition matrix and annotates each temporal patch into state probability, ensuring that the temporal representation sequence inherits language-like sequential dynamics. In Semantic Alignment, cross-attention is applied between temporal patches and the top-k tokens within each state, and the ultimate temporal embeddings are derived by the expected value of these embeddings using a weighted average based on state probabilities. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SGCMA achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering a novel approach to cross-modal alignment in time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[RIFLES: Resource-effIcient Federated LEarning via Scheduling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13169v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving machine learning technique that allows decentralized collaborative model training across a set of distributed clients, by avoiding raw data exchange. A fundamental component of FL is the selection of a subset of clients in each round for model training by a central server. Current selection strategies are myopic in nature in that they are based on past or current interactions, often leading to inefficiency issues such as straggling clients. In this paper, we address this serious shortcoming by proposing the RIFLES approach that builds a novel availability forecasting layer to support the client selection process. We make the following contributions: (i) we formalise the sequential selection problem and reduce it to a scheduling problem and show that the problem is NP-complete, (ii) leveraging heartbeat messages from clients, RIFLES build an availability prediction layer to support (long term) selection decisions, (iii) we propose a novel adaptive selection strategy to support efficient learning and resource usage. To circumvent the inherent exponential complexity, we present RIFLES, a heuristic that leverages clients' historical availability data by using a CNN-LSTM time series forecasting model, allowing the server to predict the optimal participation times of clients, thereby enabling informed selection decisions. By comparing against other FL techniques, we show that RIFLES provide significant improvement by between 10%-50% on a variety of metrics such as accuracy and test loss. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to investigate FL as a scheduling problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[panelPomp: Analysis of Panel Data via Partially Observed Markov Processes in R](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07934v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Panel data arise when time series measurements are collected from multiple, dynamically independent but structurally related systems. Each system's time series can be modeled as a partially observed Markov process (POMP), and the ensemble of these models is called a PanelPOMP. If the time series are relatively short, statistical inference for each time series must draw information from across the entire panel. The component systems in the panel are called units; model parameters may be shared between units or may be unit-specific. Differences between units may be of direct inferential interest or may be a nuisance for studying the commonalities. The R package panelPomp supports analysis of panel data via a general class of PanelPOMP models. This includes a suite of tools for manipulation of models and data that take advantage of the panel structure. The panelPomp package currently highlights recent advances enabling likelihood based inference via simulation based algorithms. However, the general framework provided by panelPomp supports development of additional, new inference methodology for panel data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Relative Positional Encoding in Spiking Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16745v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are bio-inspired networks that mimic how neurons in the brain communicate through discrete spikes, which have great potential in various tasks due to their energy efficiency and temporal processing capabilities. SNNs with self-attention mechanisms (spiking Transformers) have recently shown great advancements in various tasks, and inspired by traditional Transformers, several studies have demonstrated that spiking absolute positional encoding can help capture sequential relationships for input data, enhancing the capabilities of spiking Transformers for tasks such as sequential modeling and image classification. However, how to incorporate relative positional information into SNNs remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce several strategies to approximate relative positional encoding (RPE) in spiking Transformers while preserving the binary nature of spikes. Firstly, we formally prove that encoding relative distances with Gray Code ensures that the binary representations of positional indices maintain a constant Hamming distance whenever their decimal values differ by a power of two, and we propose Gray-PE based on this property. In addition, we propose another RPE method called Log-PE, which combines the logarithmic form of the relative distance matrix directly into the spiking attention map. Furthermore, we extend our RPE methods to a two-dimensional form, making them suitable for processing image patches. We evaluate our RPE methods on various tasks, including time series forecasting, text classification, and patch-based image classification, and the experimental results demonstrate a satisfying performance gain by incorporating our RPE methods across many architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time series saliency maps: explaining models across multiple domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13100v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional saliency map methods, popularized in computer vision, highlight individual points (pixels) of the input that contribute the most to the model's output. However, in time-series they offer limited insights as semantically meaningful features are often found in other domains. We introduce Cross-domain Integrated Gradients, a generalization of Integrated Gradients. Our method enables feature attributions on any domain that can be formulated as an invertible, differentiable transformation of the time domain. Crucially, our derivation extends the original Integrated Gradients into the complex domain, enabling frequency-based attributions. We provide the necessary theoretical guarantees, namely, path independence and completeness. Our approach reveals interpretable, problem-specific attributions that time-domain methods cannot capture, on three real-world tasks: wearable sensor heart rate extraction, electroencephalography-based seizure detection, and zero-shot time-series forecasting. We release an open-source Tensorflow/PyTorch library to enable plug-and-play cross-domain explainability for time-series models. These results demonstrate the ability of cross-domain integrated gradients to provide semantically meaningful insights in time-series models that are impossible with traditional time-domain saliency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unifying concepts in information-theoretic time-series analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13080v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Information theory is a powerful framework for quantifying complexity, uncertainty, and dynamical structure in time-series data, with widespread applicability across disciplines such as physics, finance, and neuroscience. However, the literature on these measures remains fragmented, with domain-specific terminologies, inconsistent mathematical notation, and disparate visualization conventions that hinder interdisciplinary integration. This work addresses these challenges by unifying key information-theoretic time-series measures through shared semantic definitions, standardized mathematical notation, and cohesive visual representations. We compare these measures in terms of their theoretical foundations, computational formulations, and practical interpretability -- mapping them onto a common conceptual space through an illustrative case study with functional magnetic resonance imaging time series in the brain. This case study exemplifies the complementary insights these measures offer in characterizing the dynamics of complex neural systems, such as signal complexity and information flow. By providing a structured synthesis, our work aims to enhance interdisciplinary dialogue and methodological adoption, which is particularly critical for reproducibility and interoperability in computational neuroscience. More broadly, our framework serves as a resource for researchers seeking to navigate and apply information-theoretic time-series measures to diverse complex systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages (including references), 15 figures</p></details> |
| **[Exploring Neural Granger Causality with xLSTMs: Unveiling Temporal Dependencies in Complex Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09981v3)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causality in time series can be difficult to determine, especially in the presence of non-linear dependencies. The concept of Granger causality helps analyze potential relationships between variables, thereby offering a method to determine whether one time series can predict - Granger cause - future values of another. Although successful, Granger causal methods still struggle with capturing long-range relations between variables. To this end, we leverage the recently successful Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) architecture and propose Granger causal xLSTMs (GC-xLSTM). It first enforces sparsity between the time series components by using a novel dynamic loss penalty on the initial projection. Specifically, we adaptively improve the model and identify sparsity candidates. Our joint optimization procedure then ensures that the Granger causal relations are recovered robustly. Our experimental evaluation on six diverse datasets demonstrates the overall efficacy of our proposed GC-xLSTM model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Testing procedures based on maximum likelihood estimation for Marked Hawkes processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05008v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Hawkes model is a past-dependent point process, widely used in various fields for modeling temporal clustering of events. Extending this framework, the multidimensional marked Hawkes process incorporates multiple interacting event types and additional marks, enhancing its capability to model complex dependencies in multivariate time series data. However, increasing the complexity of the model also increases the computational cost of the associated estimation methods and may induce an overfitting of the model. Therefore, it is essential to find a trade-off between accuracy and artificial complexity of the model. In order to find the appropriate version of Hawkes processes, we address, in this paper, the tasks of model fit evaluation and parameter testing for marked Hawkes processes. This article focuses on parametric Hawkes processes with exponential memory kernels, a popular variant for its theoretical and practical advantages. Our work introduces robust testing methodologies for assessing model parameters and complexity, building upon and extending previous theoretical frameworks. We then validate the practical robustness of these tests through comprehensive numerical studies, especially in scenarios where theoretical guarantees remains incomplete.</p></details> |  |
| **[TSPulse: Dual Space Tiny Pre-Trained Models for Rapid Time-Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13033v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of time-series pre-trained models has advanced temporal representation learning, but current state-of-the-art models are often large-scale, requiring substantial compute. We introduce TSPulse, ultra-compact time-series pre-trained models with only 1M parameters, specialized to perform strongly across classification, anomaly detection, imputation, and retrieval tasks. TSPulse introduces innovations at both the architecture and task levels. At the architecture level, it employs a dual-space masked reconstruction, learning from both time and frequency domains to capture complementary signals. This is further enhanced by a dual-embedding disentanglement, generating both detailed embeddings for fine-grained analysis and high-level semantic embeddings for broader task understanding. Notably, TSPulse's semantic embeddings are robust to shifts in time, magnitude, and noise, which is important for robust retrieval. At the task level, TSPulse incorporates TSLens, a fine-tuning component enabling task-specific feature attention. It also introduces a multi-head triangulation technique that correlates deviations from multiple prediction heads, enhancing anomaly detection by fusing complementary model outputs. Additionally, a hybrid mask pretraining is proposed to improves zero-shot imputation by reducing pre-training bias. These architecture and task innovations collectively contribute to TSPulse's significant performance gains: 5-16% on the UEA classification benchmarks, +20% on the TSB-AD anomaly detection leaderboard, +50% in zero-shot imputation, and +25% in time-series retrieval. Remarkably, these results are achieved with just 1M parameters, making TSPulse 10-100X smaller than existing pre-trained models. Its efficiency enables GPU-free inference and rapid pre-training, setting a new standard for efficient time-series pre-trained models. Models will be open-sourced soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agent Performing Autonomous Stock Trading under Good and Bad Situations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03985v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stock trading is one of the popular ways for financial management. However, the market and the environment of economy is unstable and usually not predictable. Furthermore, engaging in stock trading requires time and effort to analyze, create strategies, and make decisions. It would be convenient and effective if an agent could assist or even do the task of analyzing and modeling the past data and then generate a strategy for autonomous trading. Recently, reinforcement learning has been shown to be robust in various tasks that involve achieving a goal with a decision making strategy based on time-series data. In this project, we have developed a pipeline that simulates the stock trading environment and have trained an agent to automate the stock trading process with deep reinforcement learning methods, including deep Q-learning, deep SARSA, and the policy gradient method. We evaluate our platform during relatively good (before 2021) and bad (2021 - 2022) situations. The stocks we've evaluated on including Google, Apple, Tesla, Meta, Microsoft, and IBM. These stocks are among the popular ones, and the changes in trends are representative in terms of having good and bad situations. We showed that before 2021, the three reinforcement methods we have tried always provide promising profit returns with total annual rates around $70\%$ to $90\%$, while maintain a positive profit return after 2021 with total annual rates around 2% to 7%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a workshop paper at ICLR 2023: AI for Agent Based Modeling</p></details> |
| **[Temporal Query Network for Efficient Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12917v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sufficiently modeling the correlations among variables (aka channels) is crucial for achieving accurate multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF). In this paper, we propose a novel technique called Temporal Query (TQ) to more effectively capture multivariate correlations, thereby improving model performance in MTSF tasks. Technically, the TQ technique employs periodically shifted learnable vectors as queries in the attention mechanism to capture global inter-variable patterns, while the keys and values are derived from the raw input data to encode local, sample-level correlations. Building upon the TQ technique, we develop a simple yet efficient model named Temporal Query Network (TQNet), which employs only a single-layer attention mechanism and a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Extensive experiments demonstrate that TQNet learns more robust multivariate correlations, achieving state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy across 12 challenging real-world datasets. Furthermore, TQNet achieves high efficiency comparable to linear-based methods even on high-dimensional datasets, balancing performance and computational cost. The code is available at: https://github.com/ACAT-SCUT/TQNet.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Topology-driven identification of repetitions in multi-variate time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10004v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many multi-variate time series obtained in the natural sciences and engineering possess a repetitive behavior, as for instance state-space trajectories of industrial machines in discrete automation. Recovering the times of recurrence from such a multi-variate time series is of a fundamental importance for many monitoring and control tasks. For a periodic time series this is equivalent to determining its period length. In this work we present a persistent homology framework to estimate recurrence times in multi-variate time series with different generalizations of cyclic behavior (periodic, repetitive, and recurring). To this end, we provide three specialized methods within our framework that are provably stable and validate them using real-world data, including a new benchmark dataset from an injection molding machine.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appears at 6th Interdisciplinary Data Science Conference (iDSC'25)</p></details> |
| **[Decoding Time Series with LLMs: A Multi-Agent Framework for Cross-Domain Annotation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17462v3)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data is ubiquitous across various domains, including manufacturing, finance, and healthcare. High-quality annotations are essential for effectively understanding time series and facilitating downstream tasks; however, obtaining such annotations is challenging, particularly in mission-critical domains. In this paper, we propose TESSA, a multi-agent system designed to automatically generate both general and domain-specific annotations for time series data. TESSA introduces two agents: a general annotation agent and a domain-specific annotation agent. The general agent captures common patterns and knowledge across multiple source domains, leveraging both time-series-wise and text-wise features to generate general annotations. Meanwhile, the domain-specific agent utilizes limited annotations from the target domain to learn domain-specific terminology and generate targeted annotations. Extensive experiments on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that TESSA effectively generates high-quality annotations, outperforming existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 12 figures, 32 tables</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical Representations for Evolving Acyclic Vector Autoregressions (HEAVe)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12806v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal networks offer an intuitive framework to understand influence structures within time series systems. However, the presence of cycles can obscure dynamic relationships and hinder hierarchical analysis. These networks are typically identified through multivariate predictive modelling, but enforcing acyclic constraints significantly increases computational and analytical complexity. Despite recent advances, there remains a lack of simple, flexible approaches that are easily tailorable to specific problem instances. We propose an evolutionary approach to fitting acyclic vector autoregressive processes and introduces a novel hierarchical representation that directly models structural elements within a time series system. On simulated datasets, our model retains most of the predictive accuracy of unconstrained models and outperforms permutation-based alternatives. When applied to a dataset of 100 cryptocurrency return series, our method generates acyclic causal networks capturing key structural properties of the unconstrained model. The acyclic networks are approximately sub-graphs of the unconstrained networks, and most of the removed links originate from low-influence nodes. Given the high levels of feature preservation, we conclude that this cryptocurrency price system functions largely hierarchically. Our findings demonstrate a flexible, intuitive approach for identifying hierarchical causal networks in time series systems, with broad applications to fields like econometrics and social network analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Channel-Independent Time Series Forecasting via Cross-Variate Patch Embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12761v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have recently gained popularity in time series forecasting due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies. However, many existing models focus only on capturing temporal dependencies while omitting intricate relationships between variables. Recent models have tried tackling this by explicitly modeling both cross-time and cross-variate dependencies through a sequential or unified attention mechanism, but they are entirely channel dependent (CD) across all layers, making them potentially susceptible to overfitting. To address this, we propose Cross-Variate Patch Embeddings (CVPE), a lightweight CD module that injects cross-variate context into channel-independent (CI) models by simply modifying the patch embedding process. We achieve this by adding a learnable positional encoding and a lightweight router-attention block to the vanilla patch embedding layer. We then integrate CVPE into Time-LLM, a multimodal CI forecasting model, to demonstrate its effectiveness in capturing cross-variate dependencies and enhance the CI model's performance. Extensive experimental results on seven real-world datasets show that our enhanced Time-LLM outperforms the original baseline model simply by incorporating the CVPE module, with no other changes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-stationary Diffusion For Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04278v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the dynamics of underlying physics and external influences, the uncertainty of time series often varies over time. However, existing Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) often fail to capture this non-stationary nature, constrained by their constant variance assumption from the additive noise model (ANM). In this paper, we innovatively utilize the Location-Scale Noise Model (LSNM) to relax the fixed uncertainty assumption of ANM. A diffusion-based probabilistic forecasting framework, termed Non-stationary Diffusion (NsDiff), is designed based on LSNM that is capable of modeling the changing pattern of uncertainty. Specifically, NsDiff combines a denoising diffusion-based conditional generative model with a pre-trained conditional mean and variance estimator, enabling adaptive endpoint distribution modeling. Furthermore, we propose an uncertainty-aware noise schedule, which dynamically adjusts the noise levels to accurately reflect the data uncertainty at each step and integrates the time-varying variances into the diffusion process. Extensive experiments conducted on nine real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate the superior performance of NsDiff compared to existing approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/wwy155/NsDiff.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as spotlight poster at ICML</p></details> |
| **[TimeMixer++: A General Time Series Pattern Machine for Universal Predictive Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16032v5)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis plays a critical role in numerous applications, supporting tasks such as forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, and imputation. In this work, we present the time series pattern machine (TSPM), a model designed to excel in a broad range of time series tasks through powerful representation and pattern extraction capabilities. Traditional time series models often struggle to capture universal patterns, limiting their effectiveness across diverse tasks. To address this, we define multiple scales in the time domain and various resolutions in the frequency domain, employing various mixing strategies to extract intricate, task-adaptive time series patterns. Specifically, we introduce a general-purpose TSPM that processes multi-scale time series using (1) multi-resolution time imaging (MRTI), (2) time image decomposition (TID), (3) multi-scale mixing (MCM), and (4) multi-resolution mixing (MRM) to extract comprehensive temporal patterns. MRTI transforms multi-scale time series into multi-resolution time images, capturing patterns across both temporal and frequency domains. TID leverages dual-axis attention to extract seasonal and trend patterns, while MCM hierarchically aggregates these patterns across scales. MRM adaptively integrates all representations across resolutions. This method achieves state-of-the-art performance across 8 time series analytical tasks, consistently surpassing both general-purpose and task-specific models. Our work marks a promising step toward the next generation of TSPMs, paving the way for further advancements in time series analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 13th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Deep Koopman-layered Model with Universal Property Based on Toeplitz Matrices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02199v3)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose deep Koopman-layered models with learnable parameters in the form of Toeplitz matrices for analyzing the transition of the dynamics of time-series data. The proposed model has both theoretical solidness and flexibility. By virtue of the universal property of Toeplitz matrices and the reproducing property underlying the model, we show its universality and generalization property. In addition, the flexibility of the proposed model enables the model to fit time-series data coming from nonautonomous dynamical systems. When training the model, we apply Krylov subspace methods for efficient computations, which establish a new connection between Koopman operators and numerical linear algebra. We also empirically demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms existing methods on eigenvalue estimation of multiple Koopman operators for nonautonomous systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Alternators With Noise Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12544v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alternators have recently been introduced as a framework for modeling time-dependent data. They often outperform other popular frameworks, such as state-space models and diffusion models, on challenging time-series tasks. This paper introduces a new Alternator model, called Alternator++, which enhances the flexibility of traditional Alternators by explicitly modeling the noise terms used to sample the latent and observed trajectories, drawing on the idea of noise models from the diffusion modeling literature. Alternator++ optimizes the sum of the Alternator loss and a noise-matching loss. The latter forces the noise trajectories generated by the two noise models to approximate the noise trajectories that produce the observed and latent trajectories. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Alternator++ in tasks such as density estimation, time series imputation, and forecasting, showing that it outperforms several strong baselines, including Mambas, ScoreGrad, and Dyffusion.</p></details> |  |
| **[GlobalGeoTree: A Multi-Granular Vision-Language Dataset for Global Tree Species Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12513v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Global tree species mapping using remote sensing data is vital for biodiversity monitoring, forest management, and ecological research. However, progress in this field has been constrained by the scarcity of large-scale, labeled datasets. To address this, we introduce GlobalGeoTree, a comprehensive global dataset for tree species classification. GlobalGeoTree comprises 6.3 million geolocated tree occurrences, spanning 275 families, 2,734 genera, and 21,001 species across the hierarchical taxonomic levels. Each sample is paired with Sentinel-2 image time series and 27 auxiliary environmental variables, encompassing bioclimatic, geographic, and soil data. The dataset is partitioned into GlobalGeoTree-6M for model pretraining and curated evaluation subsets, primarily GlobalGeoTree-10kEval for zero-shot and few-shot benchmarking. To demonstrate the utility of the dataset, we introduce a baseline model, GeoTreeCLIP, which leverages paired remote sensing data and taxonomic text labels within a vision-language framework pretrained on GlobalGeoTree-6M. Experimental results show that GeoTreeCLIP achieves substantial improvements in zero- and few-shot classification on GlobalGeoTree-10kEval over existing advanced models. By making the dataset, models, and code publicly available, we aim to establish a benchmark to advance tree species classification and foster innovation in biodiversity research and ecological applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[CT-PatchTST: Channel-Time Patch Time-Series Transformer for Long-Term Renewable Energy Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08620v2)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting renewable energy output is crucial for the efficient integration of solar and wind power into modern energy systems. This study develops and evaluates an advanced deep learning model, Channel-Time Patch Time-Series Transformer (CT-PatchTST), to forecast the power output of photovoltaic and wind energy systems using annual offshore wind power, onshore wind power, and solar power generation data from Denmark. While the original Patch Time-Series Transformer(PatchTST) model employs a channel-independent (CI) approach, it tends to overlook inter-channel relationships during training, potentially leading to a loss of critical information. To address this limitation and further leverage the benefits of increased data granularity brought by CI, we propose CT-PatchTST. This enhanced model improves the processing of inter-channel information while maintaining the advantages of the channel-independent approach. The predictive performance of CT-PatchTST is rigorously analyzed, demonstrating its ability to provide precise and reliable energy forecasts. This work contributes to improving the predictability of renewable energy systems, supporting their broader adoption and integration into energy grids.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeNOTS: Stable Deep Neural ODEs for Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08055v3)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural CDEs provide a natural way to process the temporal evolution of irregular time series. The number of function evaluations (NFE) is these systems' natural analog of depth (the number of layers in traditional neural networks). It is usually regulated via solver error tolerance: lower tolerance means higher numerical precision, requiring more integration steps. However, lowering tolerances does not adequately increase the models' expressiveness. We propose a simple yet effective alternative: scaling the integration time horizon to increase NFEs and "deepen`` the model. Increasing the integration interval causes uncontrollable growth in conventional vector fields, so we also propose a way to stabilize the dynamics via Negative Feedback (NF). It ensures provable stability without constraining flexibility. It also implies robustness: we provide theoretical bounds for Neural ODE risk using Gaussian process theory. Experiments on four open datasets demonstrate that our method, DeNOTS, outperforms existing approaches~ -- ~including recent Neural RDEs and state space models,~ -- ~achieving up to $20\%$ improvement in metrics. DeNOTS combines expressiveness, stability, and robustness, enabling reliable modelling in continuous-time domains.</p></details> |  |

Empowered by this learning capability, it has become a powerful tool for solving complex problems and is the core driver of many groundbreaking technologies and innovations. Building a deep learning model is challenging due to the algorithm's complexity and the dynamic nature of real-world problems. Several studies have reviewed deep learning concepts and applications. However, the studies mostly focused on the types of deep learning models and convolutional neural network architectures, offering limited coverage of the state-of-the-art deep learning models and their applications in solving complex problems across different domains. Therefore, motivated by the limitations, this study aims to comprehensively review the state-of-the-art deep learning models in computer vision, natural language processing, time series analysis and pervasive computing, and robotics. We highlight the key features of the models and their effectiveness in solving the problems within each domain. Furthermore, this study presents the fundamentals of deep learning, various deep learning model types and prominent convolutional neural network architectures. Finally, challenges and future directions in deep learning research are discussed to offer a broader perspective for future researchers.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been accepted for publication in Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence (Elsevier)</p></details> |

Post hoc methods such as saliency maps may fail to reflect a model's true decision process. Prototype-based reasoning offers a more transparent alternative by grounding decisions in similarity to learned representations of real ECG segments, enabling faithful, case-based explanations. We introduce ProtoECGNet, a prototype-based deep learning model for interpretable, multi-label ECG classification. ProtoECGNet employs a structured, multi-branch architecture that reflects clinical interpretation workflows: it integrates a 1D CNN with global prototypes for rhythm classification, a 2D CNN with time-localized prototypes for morphology-based reasoning, and a 2D CNN with global prototypes for diffuse abnormalities. Each branch is trained with a prototype loss designed for multi-label learning, combining clustering, separation, diversity, and a novel contrastive loss that encourages appropriate separation between prototypes of unrelated classes while allowing clustering for frequently co-occurring diagnoses. We evaluate ProtoECGNet on all 71 diagnostic labels from the PTB-XL dataset, demonstrating competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art black-box models while providing structured, case-based explanations. To assess prototype quality, we conduct a structured clinician review of the final model's projected prototypes, finding that they are rated as representative and clear. ProtoECGNet shows that prototype learning can be effectively scaled to complex, multi-label time-series classification, offering a practical path toward transparent and trustworthy deep learning models for clinical decision support.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mamba Adaptive Anomaly Transformer with association discrepancy for time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07858v3)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in time series is essential for industrial monitoring and environmental sensing, yet distinguishing anomalies from complex patterns remains challenging. Existing methods like the Anomaly Transformer and DCdetector have progressed, but they face limitations such as sensitivity to short-term contexts and inefficiency in noisy, non-stationary environments. To overcome these issues, we introduce MAAT, an improved architecture that enhances association discrepancy modeling and reconstruction quality. MAAT features Sparse Attention, efficiently capturing long-range dependencies by focusing on relevant time steps, thereby reducing computational redundancy. Additionally, a Mamba-Selective State Space Model is incorporated into the reconstruction module, utilizing a skip connection and Gated Attention to improve anomaly localization and detection performance. Extensive experiments show that MAAT significantly outperforms previous methods, achieving better anomaly distinguishability and generalization across various time series applications, setting a new standard for unsupervised time series anomaly detection in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Backdoor Attacks on Time Series Classification in the Frequency Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09712v3)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series classification (TSC) is a cornerstone of modern web applications, powering tasks such as financial data analysis, network traffic monitoring, and user behavior analysis. In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have greatly enhanced the performance of TSC models in these critical domains. However, DNNs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where attackers can covertly implant triggers into models to induce malicious outcomes. Existing backdoor attacks targeting DNN-based TSC models remain elementary. In particular, early methods borrow trigger designs from computer vision, which are ineffective for time series data. More recent approaches utilize generative models for trigger generation, but at the cost of significant computational complexity. In this work, we analyze the limitations of existing attacks and introduce an enhanced method, FreqBack. Drawing inspiration from the fact that DNN models inherently capture frequency domain features in time series data, we identify that improper perturbations in the frequency domain are the root cause of ineffective attacks. To address this, we propose to generate triggers both effectively and efficiently, guided by frequency analysis. FreqBack exhibits substantial performance across five models and eight datasets, achieving an impressive attack success rate of over 90%, while maintaining less than a 3% drop in model accuracy on clean data.</p></details> | WWW 2025 (Oral) |
| **[Joint Manifold Learning and Optimal Transport for Dynamic Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11913v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic imaging is critical for understanding and visualizing dynamic biological processes in medicine and cell biology. These applications often encounter the challenge of a limited amount of time series data and time points, which hinders learning meaningful patterns. Regularization methods provide valuable prior knowledge to address this challenge, enabling the extraction of relevant information despite the scarcity of time-series data and time points. In particular, low-dimensionality assumptions on the image manifold address sample scarcity, while time progression models, such as optimal transport (OT), provide priors on image development to mitigate the lack of time points. Existing approaches using low-dimensionality assumptions disregard a temporal prior but leverage information from multiple time series. OT-prior methods, however, incorporate the temporal prior but regularize only individual time series, ignoring information from other time series of the same image modality. In this work, we investigate the effect of integrating a low-dimensionality assumption of the underlying image manifold with an OT regularizer for time-evolving images. In particular, we propose a latent model representation of the underlying image manifold and promote consistency between this representation, the time series data, and the OT prior on the time-evolving images. We discuss the advantages of enriching OT interpolations with latent models and integrating OT priors into latent models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Perturbed Adaptive Method for Infinite Task-Conflicting Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11902v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We formulate time series tasks as input-output mappings under varying objectives, where the same input may yield different outputs. This challenges a model's generalization and adaptability. To study this, we construct a synthetic dataset with numerous conflicting subtasks to evaluate adaptation under frequent task shifts. Existing static models consistently fail in such settings. We propose a dynamic perturbed adaptive method based on a trunk-branch architecture, where the trunk evolves slowly to capture long-term structure, and branch modules are re-initialized and updated for each task. This enables continual test-time adaptation and cross-task transfer without relying on explicit task labels. Theoretically, we show that this architecture has strictly higher functional expressivity than static models and LoRA. We also establish exponential convergence of branch adaptation under the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms competitive baselines in complex and conflicting task environments, exhibiting fast adaptation and progressive learning capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[AUTO: Adaptive Outlier Optimization for Test-Time OOD Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12267v2)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection aims to detect test samples that do not fall into any training in-distribution (ID) classes. Prior efforts focus on regularizing models with ID data only, largely underperforming counterparts that utilize auxiliary outliers. However, data safety and privacy make it infeasible to collect task-specific outliers in advance for different scenarios. Besides, using task-irrelevant outliers leads to inferior OOD detection performance. To address the above issue, we present a new setup called test-time OOD detection, which allows the deployed model to utilize real OOD data from the unlabeled data stream during testing. We propose Adaptive Outlier Optimization (AUTO) which allows for continuous adaptation of the OOD detector. Specifically, AUTO consists of three key components: 1) an in-out-aware filter to selectively annotate test samples with pseudo-ID and pseudo-OOD and ingeniously trigger the updating process while encountering each pseudo-OOD sample; 2) a dynamic-updated memory to overcome the catastrophic forgetting led by frequent parameter updates; 3) a prediction-aligning objective to calibrate the rough OOD objective during testing. Extensive experiments show that AUTO significantly improves OOD detection performance over state-of-the-art methods. Besides, evaluations on complicated scenarios (e.g. multi-OOD, time-series OOD) also conduct the superiority of AUTO.</p></details> | 14 pages |
| **[Multi-Order Wavelet Derivative Transform for Deep Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11781v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In deep time series forecasting, the Fourier Transform (FT) is extensively employed for frequency representation learning. However, it often struggles in capturing multi-scale, time-sensitive patterns. Although the Wavelet Transform (WT) can capture these patterns through frequency decomposition, its coefficients are insensitive to change points in time series, leading to suboptimal modeling. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce the multi-order Wavelet Derivative Transform (WDT) grounded in the WT, enabling the extraction of time-aware patterns spanning both the overall trend and subtle fluctuations. Compared with the standard FT and WT, which model the raw series, the WDT operates on the derivative of the series, selectively magnifying rate-of-change cues and exposing abrupt regime shifts that are particularly informative for time series modeling. Practically, we embed the WDT into a multi-branch framework named WaveTS, which decomposes the input series into multi-scale time-frequency coefficients, refines them via linear layers, and reconstructs them into the time domain via the inverse WDT. Extensive experiments on ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that WaveTS achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy while retaining high computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[Benchmarking Unsupervised Online IDS for Masquerade Attacks in CAN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13778v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicular controller area networks (CANs) are susceptible to masquerade attacks by malicious adversaries. In masquerade attacks, adversaries silence a targeted ID and then send malicious frames with forged content at the expected timing of benign frames. As masquerade attacks could seriously harm vehicle functionality and are the stealthiest attacks to detect in CAN, recent work has devoted attention to compare frameworks for detecting masquerade attacks in CAN. However, most existing works report offline evaluations using CAN logs already collected using simulations that do not comply with the domain's real-time constraints. Here we contribute to advance the state of the art by introducing a benchmark study of four different non-deep learning (DL)-based unsupervised online intrusion detection systems (IDS) for masquerade attacks in CAN. Our approach differs from existing benchmarks in that we analyze the effect of controlling streaming data conditions in a sliding window setting. In doing so, we use realistic masquerade attacks being replayed from the ROAD dataset. We show that although benchmarked IDS are not effective at detecting every attack type, the method that relies on detecting changes in the hierarchical structure of clusters of time series produces the best results at the expense of higher computational overhead. We discuss limitations, open challenges, and how the benchmarked methods can be used for practical unsupervised online CAN IDS for masquerade attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Network Anomaly Detection with Quantum GANs and Successive Data Injection for Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11631v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computing may offer new approaches for advancing machine learning, including in complex tasks such as anomaly detection in network traffic. In this paper, we introduce a quantum generative adversarial network (QGAN) architecture for multivariate time-series anomaly detection that leverages variational quantum circuits (VQCs) in combination with a time-window shifting technique, data re-uploading, and successive data injection (SuDaI). The method encodes multivariate time series data as rotation angles. By integrating both data re-uploading and SuDaI, the approach maps classical data into quantum states efficiently, helping to address hardware limitations such as the restricted number of available qubits. In addition, the approach employs an anomaly scoring technique that utilizes both the generator and the discriminator output to enhance the accuracy of anomaly detection. The QGAN was trained using the parameter shift rule and benchmarked against a classical GAN. Experimental results indicate that the quantum model achieves a accuracy high along with high recall and F1-scores in anomaly detection, and attains a lower MSE compared to the classical model. Notably, the QGAN accomplishes this performance with only 80 parameters, demonstrating competitive results with a compact architecture. Tests using a noisy simulator suggest that the approach remains effective under realistic noise-prone conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nearest Neighbor Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11625v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting has a wide range of applications in both industry and academia. Recently, spatial-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) have gained popularity as MTS forecasting methods. However, current STGNNs can only use the finite length of MTS input data due to the computational complexity. Moreover, they lack the ability to identify similar patterns throughout the entire dataset and struggle with data that exhibit sparsely and discontinuously distributed correlations among variables over an extensive historical period, resulting in only marginal improvements. In this article, we introduce a simple yet effective k-nearest neighbor MTS forecasting ( kNN-MTS) framework, which forecasts with a nearest neighbor retrieval mechanism over a large datastore of cached series, using representations from the MTS model for similarity search. This approach requires no additional training and scales to give the MTS model direct access to the whole dataset at test time, resulting in a highly expressive model that consistently improves performance, and has the ability to extract sparse distributed but similar patterns spanning over multivariables from the entire dataset. Furthermore, a hybrid spatial-temporal encoder (HSTEncoder) is designed for kNN-MTS which can capture both long-term temporal and short-term spatial-temporal dependencies and is shown to provide accurate representation for kNN-MTSfor better forecasting. Experimental results on several real-world datasets show a significant improvement in the forecasting performance of kNN-MTS. The quantitative analysis also illustrates the interpretability and efficiency of kNN-MTS, showing better application prospects and opening up a new path for efficiently using the large dataset in MTS models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heart2Mind: Human-Centered Contestable Psychiatric Disorder Diagnosis System using Wearable ECG Monitors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11612v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Psychiatric disorders affect millions globally, yet their diagnosis faces significant challenges in clinical practice due to subjective assessments and accessibility concerns, leading to potential delays in treatment. To help address this issue, we present Heart2Mind, a human-centered contestable psychiatric disorder diagnosis system using wearable electrocardiogram (ECG) monitors. Our approach leverages cardiac biomarkers, particularly heart rate variability (HRV) and R-R intervals (RRI) time series, as objective indicators of autonomic dysfunction in psychiatric conditions. The system comprises three key components: (1) a Cardiac Monitoring Interface (CMI) for real-time data acquisition from Polar H9/H10 devices; (2) a Multi-Scale Temporal-Frequency Transformer (MSTFT) that processes RRI time series through integrated time-frequency domain analysis; (3) a Contestable Diagnosis Interface (CDI) combining Self-Adversarial Explanations (SAEs) with contestable Large Language Models (LLMs). Our MSTFT achieves 91.7% accuracy on the HRV-ACC dataset using leave-one-out cross-validation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. SAEs successfully detect inconsistencies in model predictions by comparing attention-based and gradient-based explanations, while LLMs enable clinicians to validate correct predictions and contest erroneous ones. This work demonstrates the feasibility of combining wearable technology with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and contestable LLMs to create a transparent, contestable system for psychiatric diagnosis that maintains clinical oversight while leveraging advanced AI capabilities. Our implementation is publicly available at: https://github.com/Analytics-Everywhere-Lab/heart2mind.</p></details> | 41 pages |
| **[Uncertainty quantification with approximate variational learning for wearable photoplethysmography prediction tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11412v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals encode information about relative changes in blood volume that can be used to assess various aspects of cardiac health non-invasively, e.g.\ to detect atrial fibrillation (AF) or predict blood pressure (BP). Deep networks are well-equipped to handle the large quantities of data acquired from wearable measurement devices. However, they lack interpretability and are prone to overfitting, leaving considerable risk for poor performance on unseen data and misdiagnosis. Here, we describe the use of two scalable uncertainty quantification techniques: Monte Carlo Dropout and the recently proposed Improved Variational Online Newton. These techniques are used to assess the trustworthiness of models trained to perform AF classification and BP regression from raw PPG time series. We find that the choice of hyperparameters has a considerable effect on the predictive performance of the models and on the quality and composition of predicted uncertainties. E.g. the stochasticity of the model parameter sampling determines the proportion of the total uncertainty that is aleatoric, and has varying effects on predictive performance and calibration quality dependent on the chosen uncertainty quantification technique and the chosen expression of uncertainty. We find significant discrepancy in the quality of uncertainties over the predicted classes, emphasising the need for a thorough evaluation protocol that assesses local and adaptive calibration. This work suggests that the choice of hyperparameters must be carefully tuned to balance predictive performance and calibration quality, and that the optimal parameterisation may vary depending on the chosen expression of uncertainty.</p></details> |  |
| **[IISE PG&E Energy Analytics Challenge 2025: Hourly-Binned Regression Models Beat Transformers in Load Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11390v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate electricity load forecasting is essential for grid stability, resource optimization, and renewable energy integration. While transformer-based deep learning models like TimeGPT have gained traction in time-series forecasting, their effectiveness in long-term electricity load prediction remains uncertain. This study evaluates forecasting models ranging from classical regression techniques to advanced deep learning architectures using data from the ESD 2025 competition. The dataset includes two years of historical electricity load data, alongside temperature and global horizontal irradiance (GHI) across five sites, with a one-day-ahead forecasting horizon. Since actual test set load values remain undisclosed, leveraging predicted values would accumulate errors, making this a long-term forecasting challenge. We employ (i) Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and (ii) frame the task as a regression problem, using temperature and GHI as covariates to predict load for each hour, (iii) ultimately stacking 24 models to generate yearly forecasts. Our results reveal that deep learning models, including TimeGPT, fail to consistently outperform simpler statistical and machine learning approaches due to the limited availability of training data and exogenous variables. In contrast, XGBoost, with minimal feature engineering, delivers the lowest error rates across all test cases while maintaining computational efficiency. This highlights the limitations of deep learning in long-term electricity forecasting and reinforces the importance of model selection based on dataset characteristics rather than complexity. Our study provides insights into practical forecasting applications and contributes to the ongoing discussion on the trade-offs between traditional and modern forecasting methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context parroting: A simple but tough-to-beat baseline for foundation models in scientific machine learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11349v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently-developed time series foundation models for scientific machine learning exhibit emergent abilities to predict physical systems. These abilities include zero-shot forecasting, in which a model forecasts future states of a system given only a short trajectory as context. Here, we show that foundation models applied to physical systems can give accurate predictions, but that they fail to develop meaningful representations of the underlying physics. Instead, foundation models often forecast by context parroting, a simple zero-shot forecasting strategy that copies directly from the context. As a result, a naive direct context parroting model scores higher than state-of-the-art time-series foundation models on predicting a diverse range of dynamical systems, at a tiny fraction of the computational cost. We draw a parallel between context parroting and induction heads, which explains why large language models trained on text can be repurposed for time series forecasting. Our dynamical systems perspective also ties the scaling between forecast accuracy and context length to the fractal dimension of the attractor, providing insight into the previously observed in-context neural scaling laws. Context parroting thus serves as a simple but tough-to-beat baseline for future time-series foundation models and can help identify in-context learning strategies beyond parroting.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Radon-Nikodým Perspective on Anomaly Detection: Theory and Implications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18002v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Which principle underpins the design of an effective anomaly detection loss function? The answer lies in the concept of Radon-Nikod\'ym theorem, a fundamental concept in measure theory. The key insight from this article is: Multiplying the vanilla loss function with the Radon-Nikod\'ym derivative improves the performance across the board. We refer to this as RN-Loss. We prove this using the setting of PAC (Probably Approximately Correct) learnability. Depending on the context a Radon-Nikod\'ym derivative takes different forms. In the simplest case of supervised anomaly detection, Radon-Nikod\'ym derivative takes the form of a simple weighted loss. In the case of unsupervised anomaly detection (with distributional assumptions), Radon-Nikod\'ym derivative takes the form of the popular cluster based local outlier factor. We evaluate our algorithm on 96 datasets, including univariate and multivariate data from diverse domains, including healthcare, cybersecurity, and finance. We show that RN-Derivative algorithms outperform state-of-the-art methods on 68% of Multivariate datasets (based on F1 scores) and also achieves peak F1-scores on 72% of time series (Univariate) datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Anomaly Detection for Non-stationary Time Series using Recurrent Wavelet Probabilistic Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11321v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, an unsupervised Recurrent Wavelet Probabilistic Neural Network (RWPNN) is proposed, which aims at detecting anomalies in non-stationary environments by modelling the temporal features using a nonparametric density estimation network. The novel framework consists of two components, a Stacked Recurrent Encoder-Decoder (SREnc-Dec) module that captures temporal features in a latent space, and a Multi-Receptive-field Wavelet Probabilistic Network (MRWPN) that creates an ensemble probabilistic model to characterise the latent space. This formulation extends the standard wavelet probabilistic networks to wavelet deep probabilistic networks, which can handle higher data dimensionality. The MRWPN module can adapt to different rates of data variation in different datasets without imposing strong distribution assumptions, resulting in a more robust and accurate detection for Time Series Anomaly Detection (TSAD) tasks in the non-stationary environment. We carry out the assessment on 45 real-world time series datasets from various domains, verify the performance of RWPNN in TSAD tasks with several constraints, and show its ability to provide early warnings for anomalous events.</p></details> |  |
| **[Effective Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting with Fourier Adaptive Noise-Separated Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11306v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose the Fourier Adaptive Lite Diffusion Architecture (FALDA), a novel probabilistic framework for time series forecasting. First, we introduce the Diffusion Model for Residual Regression (DMRR) framework, which unifies diffusion-based probabilistic regression methods. Within this framework, FALDA leverages Fourier-based decomposition to incorporate a component-specific architecture, enabling tailored modeling of individual temporal components. A conditional diffusion model is utilized to estimate the future noise term, while our proposed lightweight denoiser, DEMA (Decomposition MLP with AdaLN), conditions on the historical noise term to enhance denoising performance. Through mathematical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that FALDA effectively reduces epistemic uncertainty, allowing probabilistic learning to primarily focus on aleatoric uncertainty. Experiments on six real-world benchmarks demonstrate that FALDA consistently outperforms existing probabilistic forecasting approaches across most datasets for long-term time series forecasting while achieving enhanced computational efficiency without compromising accuracy. Notably, FALDA also achieves superior overall performance compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) point forecasting approaches, with improvements of up to 9%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Irregular Time Series Forecasting: A Simple yet Effective Baseline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11250v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The forecasting of irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) is crucial in key areas such as healthcare, biomechanics, climate science, and astronomy. However, achieving accurate and practical predictions is challenging due to two main factors. First, the inherent irregularity and data missingness in irregular time series make modeling difficult. Second, most existing methods are typically complex and resource-intensive. In this study, we propose a general framework called APN to address these challenges. Specifically, we design a novel Time-Aware Patch Aggregation (TAPA) module that achieves adaptive patching. By learning dynamically adjustable patch boundaries and a time-aware weighted averaging strategy, TAPA transforms the original irregular sequences into high-quality, regularized representations in a channel-independent manner. Additionally, we use a simple query module to effectively integrate historical information while maintaining the model's efficiency. Finally, predictions are made by a shallow MLP. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets show that APN outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Set-Sequence Model for Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11243v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many financial prediction problems, the behavior of individual units (such as loans, bonds, or stocks) is influenced by observable unit-level factors and macroeconomic variables, as well as by latent cross-sectional effects. Traditional approaches attempt to capture these latent effects via handcrafted summary features. We propose a Set-Sequence model that eliminates the need for handcrafted features. The Set model first learns a shared cross-sectional summary at each period. The Sequence model then ingests the summary-augmented time series for each unit independently to predict its outcome. Both components are learned jointly over arbitrary sets sampled during training. Our approach harnesses the set nature of the cross-section and is computationally efficient, generating set summaries in linear time relative to the number of units. It is also flexible, allowing the use of existing sequence models and accommodating a variable number of units at inference. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our Set-Sequence model significantly outperforms benchmarks on stock return prediction and mortgage behavior tasks. Code will be released.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the Workshop on Financial AI at ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Multi-scale Representation Learning Framework for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08199v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) offers broad utility in practical settings like energy consumption and weather prediction. Accurately predicting long-term changes, however, is demanding due to the intricate temporal patterns and inherent multi-scale variations within time series. This work confronts key issues in LTSF, including the suboptimal use of multi-granularity information, the neglect of channel-specific attributes, and the unique nature of trend and seasonal components, by introducing a proficient MLP-based forecasting framework. Our method adeptly disentangles complex temporal dynamics using clear, concurrent predictions across various scales. These multi-scale forecasts are then skillfully integrated through a system that dynamically assigns importance to information from different granularities, sensitive to individual channel characteristics. To manage the specific features of temporal patterns, a two-pronged structure is utilized to model trend and seasonal elements independently. Experimental results on eight LTSF benchmarks demonstrate that MDMixer improves average MAE performance by 4.64% compared to the recent state-of-the-art MLP-based method (TimeMixer), while achieving an effective balance between training efficiency and model interpretability.</p></details> |  |

Considering one pattern occurring in one time series, we might be wondering whether the same pattern occurs in another time series with some distortion that might have a different length. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, there is no efficient framework that deals with this problem yet. In this work, we propose an algorithm that provides the exact solution of finding the most similar multidimensional subsequences between time series where there is a difference in length both between time series and between subsequences. The algorithm is built based on theoretical guarantee of correctness and efficiency. The result in simulation datasets illustrated that our approach not just only provided correct solution, but it also utilized running time only quarter of time compared against the baseline approaches. In real-world datasets, it extracted the most similar subsequences even faster (up to 20 times faster against baseline methods) and provided insights regarding the situation in stock market and following relations of multidimensional time series of baboon movement. Our approach can be used for any time series. The code and datasets of this work are provided for the public use.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Intervention-Aware Forecasting: Breaking Historical Limits from a System Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13522v3)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional time series forecasting methods predominantly rely on historical data patterns, neglecting external interventions that significantly shape future dynamics. Through control-theoretic analysis, we show that the implicit "self-stimulation" assumption limits the accuracy of these forecasts. To overcome this limitation, we propose an Intervention-Aware Time Series Forecasting (IATSF) framework explicitly designed to incorporate external interventions. We particularly emphasize textual interventions due to their unique capability to represent qualitative or uncertain influences inadequately captured by conventional exogenous variables. We propose a leak-free benchmark composed of temporally synchronized textual intervention data across synthetic and real-world scenarios. To rigorously evaluate IATSF, we develop FIATS, a lightweight forecasting model that integrates textual interventions through Channel-Aware Adaptive Sensitivity Modeling (CASM) and Channel-Aware Parameter Sharing (CAPS) mechanisms, enabling the model to adjust its sensitivity to interventions and historical data in a channel-specific manner. Extensive empirical evaluations confirm that FIATS surpasses state-of-the-art methods, highlighting that forecasting improvements stem explicitly from modeling external interventions rather than increased model complexity alone.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Time: Cross-Dimensional Frequency Supervision for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11567v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting plays a crucial role in various fields, and the methods based on frequency domain analysis have become an important branch. However, most existing studies focus on the design of elaborate model architectures and are often tailored for limited datasets, still lacking universality. Besides, the assumption of independent and identically distributed (IID) data also contradicts the strong correlation of the time domain labels. To address these issues, abandoning time domain supervision, we propose a purely frequency domain supervision approach named cross-dimensional frequency (X-Freq) loss. Specifically, based on a statistical phenomenon, we first prove that the information entropy of the time series is higher than its spectral entropy, which implies higher certainty in frequency domain and thus can provide better supervision. Secondly, the Fourier Transform and the Wavelet Transform are applied to the time dimension and the channel dimension of the time series respectively, to capture the long-term and short-term frequency variations as well as the spatial configuration features. Thirdly, the loss between predictions and targets is uniformly computed in the frequency domain. Moreover, we plug-and-play incorporate X-Freq into multiple advanced forecasting models and compare on 14 real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that, without making any modification to the original architectures or hyperparameters, X-Freq can improve the forecasting performance by an average of 3.3% on long-term forecasting datasets and 27.7% on short-term ones, showcasing superior generality and practicality. The code will be released publicly.</p></details> |  |

While Transformer-based methods effectively capture global dependencies, they often overlook short-term local variations in time series. Recent methods that adapt large language models (LLMs) into time series forecasting inherit this limitation by treating LLMs as black-box encoders, relying solely on the final-layer output and underutilizing hierarchical representations. To address this limitation, we propose Logo-LLM, a novel LLM-based framework that explicitly extracts and models multi-scale temporal features from different layers of a pre-trained LLM. Through empirical analysis, we show that shallow layers of LLMs capture local dynamics in time series, while deeper layers encode global trends. Moreover, Logo-LLM introduces lightweight Local-Mixer and Global-Mixer modules to align and integrate features with the temporal input across layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Logo-LLM achieves superior performance across diverse benchmarks, with strong generalization in few-shot and zero-shot settings while maintaining low computational overhead.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we revisit and organize the core ideas behind several key techniques, such as redundancy reduction and multi-scale modeling, which are frequently employed in advanced LTSF models. Our goal is to streamline these ideas for more efficient deep learning utilization. To this end, we introduce TimeCapsule, a model built around the principle of high-dimensional information compression that unifies these techniques in a generalized yet simplified framework. Specifically, we model time series as a 3D tensor, incorporating temporal, variate, and level dimensions, and leverage mode production to capture multi-mode dependencies while achieving dimensionality compression. We propose an internal forecast within the compressed representation domain, supported by the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA), to monitor the learning of predictive representations. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate the versatility of our method, showing that TimeCapsule can achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

However, MTL often struggles to effectively manage positive and negative transfer between tasks, which can hinder performance improvements. Task grouping addresses this challenge by organizing tasks into meaningful clusters, maximizing beneficial transfer while minimizing detrimental interactions. This paper introduces a principled approach to task grouping in MTL, advancing beyond existing methods by addressing key theoretical and practical limitations. Unlike prior studies, our method offers a theoretically grounded approach that does not depend on restrictive assumptions for constructing transfer gains. We also present a flexible mathematical programming formulation that accommodates a wide range of resource constraints, thereby enhancing its versatility. Experimental results across diverse domains, including computer vision datasets, combinatorial optimization benchmarks, and time series tasks, demonstrate the superiority of our method over extensive baselines, thereby validating its effectiveness and general applicability in MTL without sacrificing efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Binned Spectral Power Loss for Improved Prediction of Chaotic Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00472v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting multiscale chaotic dynamical systems with deep learning remains a formidable challenge due to the spectral bias of neural networks, which hinders the accurate representation of fine-scale structures in long-term predictions. This issue is exacerbated when models are deployed autoregressively, leading to compounding errors and instability. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to mitigate the spectral bias which we call the Binned Spectral Power (BSP) Loss. The BSP loss is a frequency-domain loss function that adaptively weighs errors in predicting both larger and smaller scales of the dataset. Unlike traditional losses that focus on pointwise misfits, our BSP loss explicitly penalizes deviations in the energy distribution across different scales, promoting stable and physically consistent predictions. We demonstrate that the BSP loss mitigates the well-known problem of spectral bias in deep learning. We further validate our approach for the data-driven high-dimensional time-series forecasting of a range of benchmark chaotic systems which are typically intractable due to spectral bias. Our results demonstrate that the BSP loss significantly improves the stability and spectral accuracy of neural forecasting models without requiring architectural modifications. By directly targeting spectral consistency, our approach paves the way for more robust deep learning models for long-term forecasting of chaotic dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |

Wearable sensing data, however, pose unique challenges due to their variability in patterns and frequency bands, especially for healthcare-related outcomes. The main obstacle lies in crafting generalizable representations that adapt efficiently across heterogeneous sensing configurations and applications. To address this, we propose NormWear, the first multi-modal and ubiquitous foundation model designed to extract generalized and informative representations from wearable sensing data. Specifically, we design a channel-aware attention mechanism with a shared special liaison [CLS] token to detect signal patterns in both intra-sensor and inter-sensors. This helps the model to extract more meaningful information considering both time series themselves and the relationships between input sensors. This helps the model to be widely compatible with various sensors settings. NormWear is pretrained on a diverse set of physiological signals, including PPG, ECG, EEG, GSR, and IMU, from various public datasets. Our model shows exceptional generalizability across 11 public wearable sensing datasets, spanning 18 applications in mental health, body state inference, vital sign estimation, and disease risk evaluation. It consistently outperforms competitive baselines under zero-shot, partial-shot, and full-shot settings, indicating broad applicability in real-world health applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is available at: http://github.com/Mobile-Sensing-and-UbiComp-Laboratory/NormWear</p></details> |

However, existing imputation methods focus on discrete data points and are unable to effectively model sparse data, resulting in particularly poor performance for imputing substantial missing values. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, ImputeINR, for time series imputation by employing implicit neural representations (INR) to learn continuous functions for time series. ImputeINR leverages the merits of INR in that the continuous functions are not coupled to sampling frequency and have infinite sampling frequency, allowing ImputeINR to generate fine-grained imputations even on extremely sparse observed values. Extensive experiments conducted on eight datasets with five ratios of masked values show the superior imputation performance of ImputeINR, especially for high missing ratios in time series data. Furthermore, we validate that applying ImputeINR to impute missing values in healthcare data enhances the performance of downstream disease diagnosis tasks.

However, existing methods struggle to effectively integrate exogenous texts and align them with the probabilistic nature of large language models (LLMs). Current approaches either employ shallow text-time series fusion via basic prompts or rely on deterministic numerical decoding that conflict with LLMs' token-generation paradigm, which limits contextual awareness and distribution modeling. To address these limitations, we propose CAPTime, a context-aware probabilistic multimodal time series forecasting method that leverages text-informed abstraction and autoregressive LLM decoding. Our method first encodes temporal patterns using a pretrained time series encoder, then aligns them with textual contexts via learnable interactions to produce joint multimodal representations. By combining a mixture of distribution experts with frozen LLMs, we enable context-aware probabilistic forecasting while preserving LLMs' inherent distribution modeling capabilities. Experiments on diverse time series forecasting tasks demonstrate the superior accuracy and generalization of CAPTime, particularly in multimodal scenarios. Additional analysis highlights its robustness in data-scarce scenarios through hybrid probabilistic decoding.</p></details> | 13 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Robust Amortized Bayesian Inference with Self-Consistency Losses on Unlabeled Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13483v4)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Amortized Bayesian inference (ABI) with neural networks can solve probabilistic inverse problems orders of magnitude faster than classical methods. However, ABI is not yet sufficiently robust for widespread and safe application. When performing inference on observations outside the scope of the simulated training data, posterior approximations are likely to become highly biased, which cannot be corrected by additional simulations due to the bad pre-asymptotic behavior of current neural posterior estimators. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised approach that enables training not only on labeled simulated data generated from the model, but also on \textit{unlabeled} data originating from any source, including real data. To achieve this, we leverage Bayesian self-consistency properties that can be transformed into strictly proper losses that do not require knowledge of ground-truth parameters. We test our approach on several real-world case studies, including applications to high-dimensional time-series and image data. Our results show that semi-supervised learning with unlabeled data drastically improves the robustness of ABI in the out-of-simulation regime. Notably, inference remains accurate even when evaluated on observations far away from the labeled and unlabeled data seen during training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Clustering Rooftop PV Systems via Probabilistic Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10699v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the number of rooftop photovoltaic (PV) installations increases, aggregators and system operators are required to monitor and analyze these systems, raising the challenge of integration and management of large, spatially distributed time-series data that are both high-dimensional and affected by missing values. In this work, a probabilistic entity embedding-based clustering framework is proposed to address these problems. This method encodes each PV system's characteristic power generation patterns and uncertainty as a probability distribution, then groups systems by their statistical distances and agglomerative clustering. Applied to a multi-year residential PV dataset, it produces concise, uncertainty-aware cluster profiles that outperform a physics-based baseline in representativeness and robustness, and support reliable missing-value imputation. A systematic hyperparameter study further offers practical guidance for balancing model performance and robustness.</p></details> |  |

In addition, climate change is bringing about more extreme weather events such as wildfires and heatwaves, which can increase levels of pollution and worsen the effects of pollution exposure. Recent advances in personal sensing have transformed the collection of behavioural and physiological data, leading to the potential for new improvements in healthcare. We wish to capitalise on this data, alongside new capabilities in AI for making time series predictions, in order to monitor and predict health outcomes for an individual. Thus, we present a novel workflow for predicting personalised health responses to pollution by integrating physiological data from wearable fitness devices with real-time environmental exposures. The data is collected from various sources in a secure and ethical manner, and is used to train an AI model to predict individual health responses to pollution exposure within a cloud-based, modular framework. We demonstrate that the AI model -- an Adversarial Autoencoder neural network in this case -- accurately reconstructs time-dependent health signals and captures nonlinear responses to pollution. Transfer learning is applied using data from a personal smartwatch, which increases the generalisation abilities of the AI model and illustrates the adaptability of the approach to real-world, user-generated data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Kerma...</summary><p>Kermani and Naderi share first authorship. 20 pages, 6 figures and 1 table</p></details> |

Such management is enabled by RICs, which facilitate near-real-time and non-real-time network control through xApps and rApps. However, they face limitations, including latency overhead in data exchange between the RAN and RIC, restricting real-time monitoring, and the inability to access user plain data due to privacy and security constraints, hindering use cases like beamforming and spectrum classification. In this paper, we leverage the dApps concept to enable real-time RF spectrum classification with LibIQ, a novel library for RF signals that facilitates efficient spectrum monitoring and signal classification by providing functionalities to read I/Q samples as time-series, create datasets and visualize time-series data through plots and spectrograms. Thanks to LibIQ, I/Q samples can be efficiently processed to detect external RF signals, which are subsequently classified using a CNN inside the library. To achieve accurate spectrum analysis, we created an extensive dataset of time-series-based I/Q samples, representing distinct signal types captured using a custom dApp running on a 5G deployment over the Colosseum network emulator and an OTA testbed. We evaluate our model by deploying LibIQ in heterogeneous scenarios with varying center frequencies, time windows, and external RF signals. In real-time analysis, the model classifies the processed I/Q samples, achieving an average accuracy of approximately 97.8\% in identifying signal types across all scenarios. We pledge to release both LibIQ and the dataset created as a publicly available framework upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Scalar embedding of temporal network trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02715v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A temporal network -- a collection of snapshots recording the evolution of a network whose links appear and disappear dynamically -- can be interpreted as a trajectory in graph space. In order to characterize the complex dynamics of such trajectory via the tools of time series analysis and signal processing, it is sensible to preprocess the trajectory by embedding it in a low-dimensional Euclidean space. Here we argue that, rather than the topological structure of each network snapshot, the main property of the trajectory that needs to be preserved in the embedding is the relative graph distance between snapshots. This idea naturally leads to dimensionality reduction approaches that explicitly consider relative distances, such as Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) or identifying the distance matrix as a feature matrix in which to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This paper provides a comprehensible methodology that illustrates this approach. Its application to a suite of generative network trajectory models and empirical data certify that nontrivial dynamical properties of the network trajectories are preserved already in their scalar embeddings, what enables the possibility of performing time series analysis in temporal networks.</p></details> | 26 pages, 16 figures |

Recent efforts in hardware-aware neural architecture search (NAS) automate architecture discovery for specific platforms; however, none focus on general time-series analysis with edge deployment. Leveraging the problem-solving and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLM), we propose MONAQ, a novel framework that reformulates NAS into Multi-Objective Neural Architecture Querying tasks. MONAQ is equipped with multimodal query generation for processing multimodal time-series inputs and hardware constraints, alongside an LLM agent-based multi-objective search to achieve deployment-ready models via code generation. By integrating numerical data, time-series images, and textual descriptions, MONAQ improves an LLM's understanding of time-series data. Experiments on fifteen datasets demonstrate that MONAQ-discovered models outperform both handcrafted models and NAS baselines while being more efficient.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code will be available at https://github.com/kaist-dmlab/MONAQ</p></details> |

In many real-world applications, the observed variables are vector-valued, such as in climate science where variables are defined over a spatial grid and the task is called spatio-temporal causal discovery. We motivate CD in vector-valued variable setting while considering different possibilities for the underlying model, and highlight the pitfalls of commonly-used approaches when compared to a fully vectorized approach. Furthermore, often the vector-valued variables are high-dimensional, and aggregations of the variables, such as averages, are considered in interest of efficiency and robustness. In the absence of interventional data, testing for the soundness of aggregate variables as consistent abstractions that map a low-level to a high-level structural causal model (SCM) is hard, and recent works have illustrated the stringency of conditions required for testing consistency. In this work, we take a careful look at the task of vector-valued CD via constraint-based methods, focusing on the problem of consistency of aggregation for this task. We derive three aggregation consistency scores, based on compatibility of independence models and (partial) aggregation, that quantify different aspects of the soundness of an aggregation map for the CD problem. We present the argument that the consistency of causal abstractions must be separated from the task-dependent consistency of aggregation maps. As an actionable conclusion of our findings, we propose a wrapper Adag to optimize a chosen aggregation consistency score for aggregate-CD, to make the output of CD over aggregate variables more reliable. We supplement all our findings with experimental evaluations on synthetic non-time series and spatio-temporal data.</p></details> |  |

Because causal ground truth is rarely known in the real world, simulated data plays a vital role in evaluating the performance of the various causal discovery algorithms proposed in the literature. But recent work highlighted certain artifacts of commonly used data generation techniques for a standard class of structural causal models (SCM) that may be nonphysical, including var- and R2-sortability, where the variables' variance and coefficients of determination (R2) after regressing on all other variables, respectively, increase along the causal order. Some causal methods exploit such artifacts, leading to unrealistic expectations for their performance on real-world data. Some modifications have been proposed to remove these artifacts; notably, the internally-standardized structural causal model (iSCM) avoids varsortability and largely alleviates R2-sortability on sparse causal graphs, but exhibits a reversed R2-sortability pattern for denser graphs not featured in their work. We analyze which sortability patterns we expect to see in real data, and propose a method for drawing coefficients that we argue more effectively samples the space of SCMs. Finally, we propose a novel extension of our SCM generation method to the time series setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>4th C...</summary><p>4th Conference on Causal Learning and Reasoning</p></details> |

However, standard deep learning (DL) struggles to learn generalizable features in low-data environments due to model overfitting. We propose a versatile yet data-efficient framework, Intelligently Augmented Contrastive Tensor Factorization (ITA-CTF), to learn effective representations from multi-dimensional time series. The CTF module learns core explanatory components of the time series (e.g., sensor factors, temporal factors), and importantly, their joint dependencies. Notably, unlike standard tensor factorization (TF), the CTF module incorporates a new contrastive loss optimization to induce similarity learning and class-awareness into the learnt representations for better classification performance. To strengthen this contrastive learning, the preceding ITA module generates targeted but informative augmentations that highlight realistic intra-class patterns in the original data, while preserving class-wise properties. This is achieved by dynamically sampling a "soft" class prototype to guide the warping of each query data sample, which results in an augmentation that is intelligently pattern-mixed between the "soft" class prototype and the query sample. These augmentations enable the CTF module to recognize complex intra-class variations despite the limited original training data, and seek out invariant class-wise properties for accurate classification performance. The proposed method is comprehensively evaluated on five different classification tasks. Compared to standard TF and several DL benchmarks, notable performance improvements up to 18.7% were achieved.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Expert Systems with Applications (DOI:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2025.127889)</p></details> |
| **[TimeBridge: Non-Stationarity Matters for Long-term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04442v4)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-stationarity poses significant challenges for multivariate time series forecasting due to the inherent short-term fluctuations and long-term trends that can lead to spurious regressions or obscure essential long-term relationships. Most existing methods either eliminate or retain non-stationarity without adequately addressing its distinct impacts on short-term and long-term modeling. Eliminating non-stationarity is essential for avoiding spurious regressions and capturing local dependencies in short-term modeling, while preserving it is crucial for revealing long-term cointegration across variates. In this paper, we propose TimeBridge, a novel framework designed to bridge the gap between non-stationarity and dependency modeling in long-term time series forecasting. By segmenting input series into smaller patches, TimeBridge applies Integrated Attention to mitigate short-term non-stationarity and capture stable dependencies within each variate, while Cointegrated Attention preserves non-stationarity to model long-term cointegration across variates. Extensive experiments show that TimeBridge consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both short-term and long-term forecasting. Additionally, TimeBridge demonstrates exceptional performance in financial forecasting on the CSI 500 and S&P 500 indices, further validating its robustness and effectiveness.

| **[Community Fact-Checks Do Not Break Follower Loyalty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10254v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Major social media platforms increasingly adopt community-based fact-checking to address misinformation on their platforms. While previous research has largely focused on its effect on engagement (e.g., reposts, likes), an understanding of how fact-checking affects a user's follower base is missing. In this study, we employ quasi-experimental methods to causally assess whether users lose followers after their posts are corrected via community fact-checks. Based on time-series data on follower counts for N=3516 community fact-checked posts from X, we find that community fact-checks do not lead to meaningful declines in the follower counts of users who post misleading content. This suggests that followers of spreaders of misleading posts tend to remain loyal and do not view community fact-checks as a sufficient reason to disengage. Our findings underscore the need for complementary interventions to more effectively disincentivize the production of misinformation on social media.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, a novel cross-domain knowledge transfer framework is proposed to enhance the performance of LLMs in time series forecasting -- a task of increasing relevance in fields such as energy systems, finance, and healthcare. The approach systematically infuses LLMs with structured temporal information to improve their forecasting accuracy. This study evaluates the proposed method on a real-world time series dataset and compares it to a naive baseline where the LLM receives no auxiliary information. Results show that knowledge-informed forecasting significantly outperforms the uninformed baseline in terms of predictive accuracy and generalization. These findings highlight the potential of knowledge transfer strategies to bridge the gap between LLMs and domain-specific forecasting tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Does Scaling Law Apply in Time Series Forecasting?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10172v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid expansion of model size has emerged as a key challenge in time series forecasting. From early Transformer with tens of megabytes to recent architectures like TimesNet with thousands of megabytes, performance gains have often come at the cost of exponentially increasing parameter counts. But is this scaling truly necessary? To question the applicability of the scaling law in time series forecasting, we propose Alinear, an ultra-lightweight forecasting model that achieves competitive performance using only k-level parameters. We introduce a horizon-aware adaptive decomposition mechanism that dynamically rebalances component emphasis across different forecast lengths, alongside a progressive frequency attenuation strategy that achieves stable prediction in various forecasting horizons without incurring the computational overhead of attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that Alinear consistently outperforms large-scale models while using less than 1% of their parameters, maintaining strong accuracy across both short and ultra-long forecasting horizons. Moreover, to more fairly evaluate model efficiency, we propose a new parameter-aware evaluation metric that highlights the superiority of ALinear under constrained model budgets. Our analysis reveals that the relative importance of trend and seasonal components varies depending on data characteristics rather than following a fixed pattern, validating the necessity of our adaptive design. This work challenges the prevailing belief that larger models are inherently better and suggests a paradigm shift toward more efficient time series modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identifiability of VAR(1) model in a stationary setting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03466v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider a classical First-order Vector AutoRegressive (VAR(1)) model, where we interpret the autoregressive interaction matrix as influence relationships among the components of the VAR(1) process that can be encoded by a weighted directed graph. A majority of previous work studies the structural identifiability of the graph based on time series observations and therefore relies on dynamical information. In this work we assume that an equilibrium exists, and study instead the identifiability of the graph from the stationary distribution, meaning that we seek a way to reconstruct the influence graph underlying the dynamic network using only static information. We use an approach from algebraic statistics that characterizes models using the Jacobian matroids associated with the parametrization of the models, and we introduce sufficient graphical conditions under which different graphs yield distinct steady-state distributions. Additionally, we illustrate how our results could be applied to characterize networks inspired by ecological research.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChronoSteer: Bridging Large Language Model and Time Series Foundation Model via Synthetic Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10083v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional forecasting methods rely on unimodal time series data, limiting their ability to exploit rich textual information. Recently, large language models (LLMs) and time series foundation models (TSFMs) have demonstrated powerful capability in textual reasoning and temporal modeling, respectively. Integrating the strengths of both to construct a multimodal model that concurrently leverages both temporal and textual information for future inference has emerged as a critical research challenge. To address the scarcity of event-series paired data, we propose a decoupled framework: an LLM is employed to transform textual events into revision instructions, which are then used to steer the output of TSFM. To implement this framework, we introduce ChronoSteer, a multimodal TSFM that can be steered through textual revision instructions, effectively bridging LLM and TSFM. Moreover, to mitigate the shortage of cross-modal instruction-series paired data, we devise a two-stage training strategy based on synthetic data. In addition, we also construct a high-quality multimodal time series forecasting benchmark to address the information leakage concerns during evaluation. After integrating with an LLM, ChronoSteer, which is trained exclusively on synthetic data, achieves a 25.7% improvement in prediction accuracy compared to the unimodal backbone and a 22.5% gain over the previous state-of-the-art multimodal method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Limit Theorems for the Symbolic Correlation Integral and the Renyi-2 Entropy under Short-range Dependence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18726v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The symbolic correlation integral provides a way to measure the complexity of time series and dynamical systems. In the present article we prove limit results for an estimator of this quantity which is based on U-statistics under the assumption of short-range dependence. To this end, we slightly generalize classical limit results in the framework of 1-approximating functionals. Furthermore, we carefully analyze the limit variance. A simulation study with ARMA and ARCH time series as well as a real world data example are also provided. In the latter we show how our method could be used to analyze EEG data in the context of epileptic seizures.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 1 figure, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[SensorChat: Answering Qualitative and Quantitative Questions during Long-Term Multimodal Sensor Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02883v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural language interaction with sensing systems is crucial for addressing users' personal concerns and providing health-related insights into their daily lives. When a user asks a question, the system automatically analyzes the full history of sensor data, extracts relevant information, and generates an appropriate response. However, existing systems are limited to short-duration (e.g., one minute) or low-frequency (e.g., daily step count) sensor data. In addition, they struggle with quantitative questions that require precise numerical answers. In this work, we introduce SensorChat, the first end-to-end QA system designed for daily life monitoring using long-duration, high-frequency time series data. Given raw sensor signals spanning multiple days and a user-defined natural language question, SensorChat generates semantically meaningful responses that directly address user concerns. SensorChat effectively handles both quantitative questions that require numerical precision and qualitative questions that require high-level reasoning to infer subjective insights. To achieve this, SensorChat uses an innovative three-stage pipeline including question decomposition, sensor data query, and answer assembly. The first and third stages leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret human queries and generate responses. The intermediate querying stage extracts relevant information from the complete sensor data history. Real-world implementation demonstrate SensorChat's capability for real-time interactions on a cloud server while also being able to run entirely on edge platforms after quantization. Comprehensive QA evaluations show that SensorChat achieves up to 93% higher answer accuracy than state-of-the-art systems on quantitative questions. Additionally, a user study with eight volunteers highlights SensorChat's effectiveness in answering qualitative and open-ended questions.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[TSINR: Capturing Temporal Continuity via Implicit Neural Representations for Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11641v3)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection aims to identify unusual patterns in data or deviations from systems' expected behavior. The reconstruction-based methods are the mainstream in this task, which learn point-wise representation via unsupervised learning. However, the unlabeled anomaly points in training data may cause these reconstruction-based methods to learn and reconstruct anomalous data, resulting in the challenge of capturing normal patterns. In this paper, we propose a time series anomaly detection method based on implicit neural representation (INR) reconstruction, named TSINR, to address this challenge. Due to the property of spectral bias, TSINR enables prioritizing low-frequency signals and exhibiting poorer performance on high-frequency abnormal data. Specifically, we adopt INR to parameterize time series data as a continuous function and employ a transformer-based architecture to predict the INR of given data. As a result, the proposed TSINR method achieves the advantage of capturing the temporal continuity and thus is more sensitive to discontinuous anomaly data. In addition, we further design a novel form of INR continuous function to learn inter- and intra-channel information, and leverage a pre-trained large language model to amplify the intense fluctuations in anomalies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TSINR achieves superior overall performance on both univariate and multivariate time series anomaly detection benchmarks compared to other state-of-the-art reconstruction-based methods. Our codes are available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGKDD 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Stable Measure for Conditional Periodicity of Time Series using Persistent Homology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02817v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a pair of time series, we study how the periodicity of one influences the periodicity of the other. There are several known methods to measure the similarity between a pair of time series, such as cross-correlation, coherence, cross-recurrence, and dynamic time warping. But we have yet to find any measures with theoretical stability results. Persistence homology has been utilized to construct a scoring function with theoretical guarantees of stability that quantifies the periodicity of a single univariate time series f1, denoted score(f1). Building on this concept, we propose a conditional periodicity score that quantifies the periodicity of one univariate time series f1 given another f2, denoted score(f1|f2), and derive theoretical stability results for the same. With the use of dimension reduction in mind, we prove a new stability result for score(f1|f2) under principal component analysis (PCA) when we use the projections of the time series embeddings onto their respective first K principal components. We show that the change in our score is bounded by a function of the eigenvalues corresponding to the remaining (unused) N-K principal components and hence is small when the first K principal components capture most of the variation in the time series embeddings. Finally we derive a lower bound on the minimum embedding dimension to use in our pipeline which guarantees that any two such embeddings give scores that are within a given epsilon of each other. We present a procedure for computing conditional periodicity scores and implement it on several pairs of synthetic signals. We experimentally compare our similarity measure to the most-similar statistical measure of cross-recurrence, and show the increased accuracy and stability of our score when predicting and measuring whether or not the periodicities of two time series are similar.</p></details> |  |
| **[TransPL: VQ-Code Transition Matrices for Pseudo-Labeling of Time Series Unsupervised Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09955v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for time series data remains a critical challenge in deep learning, with traditional pseudo-labeling strategies failing to capture temporal patterns and channel-wise shifts between domains, producing sub-optimal pseudo-labels. As such, we introduce TransPL, a novel approach that addresses these limitations by modeling the joint distribution $P(\mathbf{X}, y)$ of the source domain through code transition matrices, where the codes are derived from vector quantization (VQ) of time series patches. Our method constructs class- and channel-wise code transition matrices from the source domain and employs Bayes' rule for target domain adaptation, generating pseudo-labels based on channel-wise weighted class-conditional likelihoods. TransPL offers three key advantages: explicit modeling of temporal transitions and channel-wise shifts between different domains, versatility towards different UDA scenarios (e.g., weakly-supervised UDA), and explainable pseudo-label generation. We validate TransPL's effectiveness through extensive analysis on four time series UDA benchmarks and confirm that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art pseudo-labeling methods by a strong margin (6.1% accuracy improvement, 4.9% F1 improvement), while providing interpretable insights into the domain adaptation process through its learned code transition matrices.</p></details> | ICML 2025 Accept |
| **[Efficient Transformed Gaussian Process State-Space Models for Non-Stationary High-Dimensional Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18309v3)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian process state-space models (GPSSMs) offer a principled framework for learning and inference in nonlinear dynamical systems with uncertainty quantification. However, existing GPSSMs are limited by the use of multiple independent stationary Gaussian processes (GPs), leading to prohibitive computational and parametric complexity in high-dimensional settings and restricted modeling capacity for non-stationary dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient transformed Gaussian process state-space model (ETGPSSM) for scalable and flexible modeling of high-dimensional, non-stationary dynamical systems. Specifically, our ETGPSSM integrates a single shared GP with input-dependent normalizing flows, yielding an expressive implicit process prior that captures complex, non-stationary transition dynamics while significantly reducing model complexity. For the inference of the implicit process, we develop a variational inference algorithm that jointly approximates the posterior over the underlying GP and the neural network parameters defining the normalizing flows. To avoid explicit variational parameterization of the latent states, we further incorporate the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) into the variational framework, enabling accurate and efficient state estimation. Extensive empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our ETGPSSM in system dynamics learning, high-dimensional state estimation, and time-series forecasting, outperforming existing GPSSMs and neural network-based SSMs in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |
| **[MTDT: A Multi-Task Deep Learning Digital Twin](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00922v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic congestion has significant impacts on both the economy and the environment. Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs) have long been the standard for evaluating traffic intersections' level of service and operational efficiency. However, the scarcity of traditional high-resolution loop detector data (ATSPM) presents challenges in accurately measuring MOEs or capturing the intricate spatiotemporal characteristics inherent in urban intersection traffic. To address this challenge, we present a comprehensive intersection traffic flow simulation that utilizes a multi-task learning paradigm. This approach combines graph convolutions for primary estimating lane-wise exit and inflow with time series convolutions for secondary assessing multi-directional queue lengths and travel time distribution through any arbitrary urban traffic intersection. Compared to existing deep learning methodologies, the proposed Multi-Task Deep Learning Digital Twin (MTDT) distinguishes itself through its adaptability to local temporal and spatial features, such as signal timing plans, intersection topology, driving behaviors, and turning movement counts. We also show the benefit of multi-task learning in the effectiveness of individual traffic simulation tasks. Furthermore, our approach facilitates sequential computation and provides complete parallelization through GPU implementation. This not only streamlines the computational process but also enhances scalability and performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

The framework incorporates a diffusion model tailored for time series generation to enhance the accuracy of the load forecasting module used in the system operation. In the absence of explicit state transition law, a model-identification procedure is leveraged to derive the system dynamics, thereby eliminating a barrier when applying MPC to a renewables-dominated power system. Case study results on an industry park system and the IEEE 30-bus system demonstrate that using the diffusion model to augment the training dataset significantly improves load-forecasting accuracy, and the inferred system dynamics are applicable to the real-time grid operation with solar and wind.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by the 2025 IEEE PES General Meeting (PESGM), which will be held in Austin, TX, July 27-31, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Avocado Price Prediction Using a Hybrid Deep Learning Model: TCN-MLP-Attention Architecture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09907v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing demand for healthy foods, agricultural product price forecasting has become increasingly important. Hass avocados, as a high-value crop, exhibit complex price fluctuations influenced by factors such as seasonality, region, and weather. Traditional prediction models often struggle with highly nonlinear and dynamic data. To address this, we propose a hybrid deep learning model, TCN-MLP-Attention Architecture, combining Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) for sequential feature extraction, Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) for nonlinear interactions, and an Attention mechanism for dynamic feature weighting. The dataset used covers over 50,000 records of Hass avocado sales across the U.S. from 2015 to 2018, including variables such as sales volume, average price, time, region, weather, and variety type, collected from point-of-sale systems and the Hass Avocado Board. After systematic preprocessing, including missing value imputation and feature normalization, the proposed model was trained and evaluated. Experimental results demonstrate that the TCN-MLP-Attention model achieves excellent predictive performance, with an RMSE of 1.23 and an MSE of 1.51, outperforming traditional methods. This research provides a scalable and effective approach for time series forecasting in agricultural markets and offers valuable insights for intelligent supply chain management and price strategy optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Best Practices for ECG Pre-Processing in Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04229v2)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work we search for best practices in pre-processing of Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals in order to train better classifiers for the diagnosis of heart conditions. State of the art machine learning algorithms have achieved remarkable results in classification of some heart conditions using ECG data, yet there appears to be no consensus on pre-processing best practices. Is this lack of consensus due to different conditions and architectures requiring different processing steps for optimal performance? Is it possible that state of the art deep-learning models have rendered pre-processing unnecessary? In this work we apply down-sampling, normalization, and filtering functions to 3 different multi-label ECG datasets and measure their effects on 3 different high-performing time-series classifiers. We find that sampling rates as low as 50Hz can yield comparable results to the commonly used 500Hz. This is significant as smaller sampling rates will result in smaller datasets and models, which require less time and resources to train. Additionally, despite their common usage, we found min-max normalization to be slightly detrimental overall, and band-passing to make no measurable difference. We found the blind approach to pre-processing of ECGs for multi-label classification to be ineffective, with the exception of sample rate reduction which reliably reduces computational resources, but does not increase accuracy.</p></details> |  |
