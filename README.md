| **[Large AI Model for Delay-Doppler Domain Channel Prediction in 6G OTFS-Based Vehicular Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01116v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Channel prediction is crucial for high-mobility vehicular networks, as it enables the anticipation of future channel conditions and the proactive adjustment of communication strategies. However, achieving accurate vehicular channel prediction is challenging due to significant Doppler effects and rapid channel variations resulting from high-speed vehicle movement and complex propagation environments. In this paper, we propose a novel delay-Doppler (DD) domain channel prediction framework tailored for high-mobility vehicular networks. By transforming the channel representation into the DD domain, we obtain an intuitive, sparse, and stable depiction that closely aligns with the underlying physical propagation processes, effectively reducing the complex vehicular channel to a set of time-series parameters with enhanced predictability. Furthermore, we leverage the large artificial intelligence (AI) model to predict these DD-domain time-series parameters, capitalizing on their advanced ability to model temporal correlations. The zero-shot capability of the pre-trained large AI model facilitates accurate channel predictions without requiring task-specific training, while subsequent fine-tuning on specific vehicular channel data further improves prediction accuracy. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our DD-domain channel prediction framework and the superior accuracy of the large AI model in predicting time-series channel parameters, thereby highlighting the potential of our approach for robust vehicular communication systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been accepted by SCIENCE CHINA Information Sciences</p></details> |
| **[Advanced Stock Market Prediction Using Long Short-Term Memory Networks: A Comprehensive Deep Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05325v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting stock market movements remains a persistent challenge due to the inherently volatile, non-linear, and stochastic nature of financial time series data. This paper introduces a deep learning-based framework employing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to forecast the closing stock prices of major technology firms: Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, listed on NASDAQ. Historical data was sourced from Yahoo Finance and processed using normalization and feature engineering techniques. The proposed model achieves a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 2.72 on unseen test data, significantly outperforming traditional models like ARIMA. To further enhance predictive accuracy, sentiment scores were integrated using real-time news articles and social media data, analyzed through the VADER sentiment analysis tool. A web application was also developed to provide real-time visualizations of stock price forecasts, offering practical utility for both individual and institutional investors. This research demonstrates the strength of LSTM networks in modeling complex financial sequences and presents a novel hybrid approach combining time series modeling with sentiment analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 17 figures, submitted as a pre-final year undergraduate project at Indian Institute of Information Technology, Gwalior.

| **[On robustness of Spectral RÃ©nyi divergence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06902v3)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies a specific category of statistical divergences for spectral densities of time series: the spectral $\alpha$-R\'{e}nyi divergences, which includes the Itakura--Saito divergence as a subset. The aim of this paper is to highlight both information-theoretic and statistical properties of spectral $\alpha$-R\'{e}nyi divergences. We reveal the connection between the spectral $\alpha$-R\'{e}nyi divergence and the $\gamma$-divergence in robust statistics, and a variational representation of spectral $\alpha$-R\'{e}nyi divergence. Inspired by these results suggesting ``robustness'' of spectral $\alpha$-R\'{e}nyi divergence, we show that the minimum spectral R\'{e}nyi divergence estimate has a stable optimization path with respect to outliers in the frequency domain, unlike the minimum Itakura-Saito divergence estimator, and thus it delivers more stable estimate, reducing the need for intricate pre-processing.</p></details> |  |
| **[T2S: High-resolution Time Series Generation with Text-to-Series Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02417v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-Time Series generation holds significant potential to address challenges such as data sparsity, imbalance, and limited availability of multimodal time series datasets across domains. While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in Text-to-X (e.g., vision and audio data) generation, their use in time series generation remains in its nascent stages. Existing approaches face two critical limitations: (1) the lack of systematic exploration of general-proposed time series captions, which are often domain-specific and struggle with generalization; and (2) the inability to generate time series of arbitrary lengths, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we first categorize time series captions into three levels: point-level, fragment-level, and instance-level. Additionally, we introduce a new fragment-level dataset containing over 600,000 high-resolution time series-text pairs. Second, we propose Text-to-Series (T2S), a diffusion-based framework that bridges the gap between natural language and time series in a domain-agnostic manner. T2S employs a length-adaptive variational autoencoder to encode time series of varying lengths into consistent latent embeddings. On top of that, T2S effectively aligns textual representations with latent embeddings by utilizing Flow Matching and employing Diffusion Transformer as the denoiser. We train T2S in an interleaved paradigm across multiple lengths, allowing it to generate sequences of any desired length. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that T2S achieves state-of-the-art performance across 13 datasets spanning 12 domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 34th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Estimation of the long-run variance of nonlinear time series with an application to change point analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02643v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For a broad class of nonlinear time series known as Bernoulli shifts, we establish the asymptotic normality of the smoothed periodogram estimator of the long-run variance. This estimator uses only a narrow band of Fourier frequencies around the origin and so has been extensively used in local Whittle estimation. Existing asymptotic normality results apply only to linear time series, so our work substantially extends the scope of the applicability of the smoothed periodogram estimator. As an illustration, we apply it to a test of changes in mean against long-range dependence. A simulation study is also conducted to illustrate the performance of the test for nonlinear time series.</p></details> | 32 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Generative Models for Long Time Series: Approximately Equivariant Recurrent Network Structures for an Adjusted Training Scheme](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05020v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a simple yet effective generative model for time series data based on a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with recurrent layers, referred to as the Recurrent Variational Autoencoder with Subsequent Training (RVAE-ST). Our method introduces an adapted training scheme that progressively increases the sequence length, addressing the challenge recurrent layers typically face when modeling long sequences. By leveraging the recurrent architecture, the model maintains a constant number of parameters regardless of sequence length. This design encourages approximate time-shift equivariance and enables efficient modeling of long-range temporal dependencies. Rather than introducing a fundamentally new architecture, we show that a carefully composed combination of known components can match or outperform state-of-the-art generative models on several benchmark datasets. Our model performs particularly well on time series that exhibit quasi-periodic structure,while remaining competitive on datasets with more irregular or partially non-stationary behavior. We evaluate its performance using ELBO, Fr\'echet Distance, discriminative scores, and visualizations of the learned embeddings.</p></details> |  |
| **[CATCH: Channel-Aware multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection via Frequency Patching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12261v4)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in multivariate time series is challenging as heterogeneous subsequence anomalies may occur. Reconstruction-based methods, which focus on learning normal patterns in the frequency domain to detect diverse abnormal subsequences, achieve promising results, while still falling short on capturing fine-grained frequency characteristics and channel correlations. To contend with the limitations, we introduce CATCH, a framework based on frequency patching. We propose to patchify the frequency domain into frequency bands, which enhances its ability to capture fine-grained frequency characteristics. To perceive appropriate channel correlations, we propose a Channel Fusion Module (CFM), which features a patch-wise mask generator and a masked-attention mechanism. Driven by a bi-level multi-objective optimization algorithm, the CFM is encouraged to iteratively discover appropriate patch-wise channel correlations, and to cluster relevant channels while isolating adverse effects from irrelevant channels. Extensive experiments on 10 real-world datasets and 12 synthetic datasets demonstrate that CATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance. We make our code and datasets available at https://github.com/decisionintelligence/CATCH.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Model Selection for Unit-root Time Series with Many Predictors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04884v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies model selection for general unit-root time series, including the case with many exogenous predictors. We propose FHTD, a new model selection algorithm that leverages forward stepwise regression (FSR), a high-dimensional information criterion (HDIC), a backward elimination method based on HDIC, and a data-driven thresholding (DDT) approach. Under some mild assumptions that allow for unknown locations and multiplicities of the characteristic roots on the unit circle of the time series and conditional heteroscedasticity in the predictors and errors, we establish the sure screening property of FSR and the selection consistency of FHTD. Central to our analysis are two key technical contributions, a new functional central limit theorem for multivariate linear processes and a uniform lower bound for the minimum eigenvalue of the sample covariance matrices, both of which are of independent interest. Simulation results corroborate the theoretical properties and show the superior performance of FHTD in model selection. We showcase the application of the proposed FHTD by modeling U.S. monthly housing starts and unemployment data.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Multivariate Financial Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17664v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article investigates the use of Machine Learning and Deep Learning models in multivariate time series analysis within financial markets. It compares small and big data approaches, focusing on their distinct challenges and the benefits of scaling. Traditional methods such as SVMs are contrasted with modern architectures like ConvTimeNet. The results show the importance of using and understanding Big Data in depth in the analysis and prediction of financial time series.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multitask LSTM for Arboviral Outbreak Prediction Using Public Health Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04566v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a multitask learning approach based on long-short-term memory (LSTM) networks for the joint prediction of arboviral outbreaks and case counts of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika in Recife, Brazil. Leveraging historical public health data from DataSUS (2017-2023), the proposed model concurrently performs binary classification (outbreak detection) and regression (case forecasting) tasks. A sliding window strategy was adopted to construct temporal features using varying input lengths (60, 90, and 120 days), with hyperparameter optimization carried out using Keras Tuner. Model evaluation used time series cross-validation for robustness and a held-out test from 2023 for generalization assessment. The results show that longer windows improve dengue regression accuracy, while classification performance peaked at intermediate windows, suggesting an optimal trade-off between sequence length and generalization. The multitask architecture delivers competitive performance across diseases and tasks, demonstrating the feasibility and advantages of unified modeling strategies for scalable epidemic forecasting in data-limited public health scenarios.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Contaminated Multivariate Time-Series Anomaly Detection with Spatio-Temporal Graph Conditional Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12563v4)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mainstream unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms often excel in academic datasets, yet their real-world performance is restricted due to the controlled experimental conditions involving clean training data. Addressing the challenge of training with noise, a prevalent issue in practical anomaly detection, is frequently overlooked. In a pioneering endeavor, this study delves into the realm of label-level noise within sensory time-series anomaly detection (TSAD). This paper presents a novel and practical end-to-end unsupervised TSAD when the training data is contaminated with anomalies. The introduced approach, called TSAD-C, is devoid of access to abnormality labels during the training phase. TSAD-C encompasses three core modules: a Decontaminator to rectify anomalies (aka noise) present during training, a Long-range Variable Dependency Modeling module to capture long-term intra- and inter-variable dependencies within the decontaminated data that is considered as a surrogate of the pure normal data, and an Anomaly Scoring module to detect anomalies from all types. Our extensive experiments conducted on four reliable and diverse datasets conclusively demonstrate that TSAD-C surpasses existing methodologies, thus establishing a new state-of-the-art in the TSAD field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Ranked differences Pearson correlation dissimilarity with an application to electricity users time series clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02173v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series clustering is an unsupervised learning method for classifying time series data into groups with similar behavior. It is used in applications such as healthcare, finance, economics, energy, and climate science. Several time series clustering methods have been introduced and used for over four decades. Most of them focus on measuring either Euclidean distances or association dissimilarities between time series. In this work, we propose a new dissimilarity measure called ranked Pearson correlation dissimilarity (RDPC), which combines a weighted average of a specified fraction of the largest element-wise differences with the well-known Pearson correlation dissimilarity. It is incorporated into hierarchical clustering. The performance is evaluated and compared with existing clustering algorithms. The results show that the RDPC algorithm outperforms others in complicated cases involving different seasonal patterns, trends, and peaks. Finally, we demonstrate our method by clustering a random sample of customers from a Thai electricity consumption time series dataset into seven groups with unique characteristics.</p></details> | 17 pages |
| **[Recognizing Ornaments in Vocal Indian Art Music with Active Annotation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04419v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ornamentations, embellishments, or microtonal inflections are essential to melodic expression across many musical traditions, adding depth, nuance, and emotional impact to performances. Recognizing ornamentations in singing voices is key to MIR, with potential applications in music pedagogy, singer identification, genre classification, and controlled singing voice generation. However, the lack of annotated datasets and specialized modeling approaches remains a major obstacle for progress in this research area. In this work, we introduce R\=aga Ornamentation Detection (ROD), a novel dataset comprising Indian classical music recordings curated by expert musicians. The dataset is annotated using a custom Human-in-the-Loop tool for six vocal ornaments marked as event-based labels. Using this dataset, we develop an ornamentation detection model based on deep time-series analysis, preserving ornament boundaries during the chunking of long audio recordings. We conduct experiments using different train-test configurations within the ROD dataset and also evaluate our approach on a separate, manually annotated dataset of Indian classical concert recordings. Our experimental results support the superior performance of our proposed approach over the baseline CRNN.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Systematic Literature Review of Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network Models for Time Series Forecasting and Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22377v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, spatio-temporal graph neural networks (GNNs) have attracted considerable interest in the field of time series analysis, due to their ability to capture dependencies among variables and across time points. The objective of the presented systematic literature review is hence to provide a comprehensive overview of the various modeling approaches and application domains of GNNs for time series classification and forecasting. A database search was conducted, and over 150 journal papers were selected for a detailed examination of the current state-of-the-art in the field. This examination is intended to offer to the reader a comprehensive collection of proposed models, links to related source code, available datasets, benchmark models, and fitting results. All this information is hoped to assist researchers in future studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic literature review presenting a detailed comparison of the results of current spatio-temporal GNN models in different domains. In addition, in its final part this review discusses current limitations and challenges in the application of spatio-temporal GNNs, such as comparability, reproducibility, explainability, poor information capacity, and scalability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-stationary Diffusion For Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04278v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the dynamics of underlying physics and external influences, the uncertainty of time series often varies over time. However, existing Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) often fail to capture this non-stationary nature, constrained by their constant variance assumption from the additive noise model (ANM). In this paper, we innovatively utilize the Location-Scale Noise Model (LSNM) to relax the fixed uncertainty assumption of ANM. A diffusion-based probabilistic forecasting framework, termed Non-stationary Diffusion (NsDiff), is designed based on LSNM that is capable of modeling the changing pattern of uncertainty. Specifically, NsDiff combines a denoising diffusion-based conditional generative model with a pre-trained conditional mean and variance estimator, enabling adaptive endpoint distribution modeling. Furthermore, we propose an uncertainty-aware noise schedule, which dynamically adjusts the noise levels to accurately reflect the data uncertainty at each step and integrates the time-varying variances into the diffusion process. Extensive experiments conducted on nine real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate the superior performance of NsDiff compared to existing approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/wwy155/NsDiff.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as spotlight poster at ICML</p></details> |
| **[Generating Building-Level Heat Demand Time Series by Combining Occupancy Simulations and Thermal Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05427v3)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite various efforts, decarbonizing the heating sector remains a significant challenge. To tackle it by smart planning, the availability of highly resolved heating demand data is key. Several existing models provide heating demand only for specific applications. Typically, they either offer time series for a larger area or annual demand data on a building level, but not both simultaneously. Additionally, the diversity in heating demand across different buildings is often not considered. To address these limitations, this paper presents a novel method for generating temporally resolved heat demand time series at the building level using publicly available data. The approach integrates a thermal building model with stochastic occupancy simulations that account for variability in user behavior. As a result, the tool serves as a cost-effective resource for cross-sectoral energy system planning and policy development, particularly with a focus on the heating sector. The obtained data can be used to assess the impact of renovation and retrofitting strategies, or to analyze district heating expansion. To illustrate the potential applications of this approach, we conducted a case study in Puertollano (Spain), where we prepared a dataset of heating demand with hourly resolution for each of 9,298 residential buildings. This data was then used to compare two different pathways for the thermal renovation of these buildings. By relying on publicly available data, this method can be adapted and applied to various European regions, offering broad usability in energy system optimization and analysis of decarbonization strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[STRGCN: Capturing Asynchronous Spatio-Temporal Dependencies for Irregular Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04167v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) are prevalent in real-world applications across many fields, where varying sensor frequencies and asynchronous measurements pose significant modeling challenges. Existing solutions often rely on a pre-alignment strategy to normalize data, which can distort intrinsic patterns and escalate computational and memory demands. Addressing these limitations, we introduce STRGCN, a Spatio-Temporal Relational Graph Convolutional Network that avoids pre-alignment and directly captures the complex interdependencies in IMTS by representing them as a fully connected graph. Each observation is represented as a node, allowing the model to effectively handle misaligned timestamps by mapping all inter-node relationships, thus faithfully preserving the asynchronous nature of the data. Moreover, we enhance this model with a hierarchical ``Sandwich'' structure that strategically aggregates nodes to optimize graph embeddings, reducing computational overhead while maintaining detailed local and global context. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that STRGCN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, competitive memory usage and training speed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Retrieval Augmented Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04163v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting uses historical data to predict future trends, leveraging the relationships between past observations and available features. In this paper, we propose RAFT, a retrieval-augmented time series forecasting method to provide sufficient inductive biases and complement the model's learning capacity. When forecasting the subsequent time frames, we directly retrieve historical data candidates from the training dataset with patterns most similar to the input, and utilize the future values of these candidates alongside the inputs to obtain predictions. This simple approach augments the model's capacity by externally providing information about past patterns via retrieval modules. Our empirical evaluations on ten benchmark datasets show that RAFT consistently outperforms contemporary baselines with an average win ratio of 86%.</p></details> |  |
| **[FilterTS: Comprehensive Frequency Filtering for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04158v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting is crucial across various industries, where accurate extraction of complex periodic and trend components can significantly enhance prediction performance. However, existing models often struggle to capture these intricate patterns. To address these challenges, we propose FilterTS, a novel forecasting model that utilizes specialized filtering techniques based on the frequency domain. FilterTS introduces a Dynamic Cross-Variable Filtering Module, a key innovation that dynamically leverages other variables as filters to extract and reinforce shared variable frequency components across variables in multivariate time series. Additionally, a Static Global Filtering Module captures stable frequency components, identified throughout the entire training set. Moreover, the model is built in the frequency domain, converting time-domain convolutions into frequency-domain multiplicative operations to enhance computational efficiency. Extensive experimental results on eight real-world datasets have demonstrated that FilterTS significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Conditional Lagrangian Wasserstein Flow for Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07550v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series imputation is important for numerous real-world applications. To overcome the limitations of diffusion model-based imputation methods, e.g., slow convergence in inference, we propose a novel method for time series imputation in this work, called Conditional Lagrangian Wasserstein Flow (CLWF). Following the principle of least action in Lagrangian mechanics, we learn the velocity by minimizing the corresponding kinetic energy. Moreover, to enhance the model's performance, we estimate the gradient of a task-specific potential function using a time-dependent denoising autoencoder and integrate it into the base estimator to reduce the sampling variance. Finally, the proposed method demonstrates competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art imputation approaches.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware Digital Twins: Robust Model Predictive Control using Time-Series Deep Quantile Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10337v3)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital Twins, virtual replicas of physical systems that enable real-time monitoring, model updates, predictions, and decision-making, present novel avenues for proactive control strategies for autonomous systems. However, achieving real-time decision-making in Digital Twins considering uncertainty necessitates an efficient uncertainty quantification (UQ) approach and optimization driven by accurate predictions of system behaviors, which remains a challenge for learning-based methods. This paper presents a simultaneous multi-step robust model predictive control (MPC) framework that incorporates real-time decision-making with uncertainty awareness for Digital Twin systems. Leveraging a multistep ahead predictor named Time-Series Dense Encoder (TiDE) as the surrogate model, this framework differs from conventional MPC models that provide only one-step ahead predictions. In contrast, TiDE can predict future states within the prediction horizon in a one-shot, significantly accelerating MPC. Furthermore, quantile regression is employed with the training of TiDE to perform flexible while computationally efficient UQ on data uncertainty. Consequently, with the deep learning quantiles, the robust MPC problem is formulated into a deterministic optimization problem and provides a safety buffer that accommodates disturbances to enhance constraint satisfaction rate. As a result, the proposed method outperforms existing robust MPC methods by providing less-conservative UQ and has demonstrated efficacy in an engineering case study involving Directed Energy Deposition (DED) additive manufacturing. This proactive while uncertainty-aware control capability positions the proposed method as a potent tool for future Digital Twin applications and real-time process control in engineering systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[BRIDGE: Bootstrapping Text to Control Time-Series Generation via Multi-Agent Iterative Optimization and Diffusion Modelling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02445v3)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series Generation (TSG) is a prominent research area with broad applications in simulations, data augmentation, and counterfactual analysis. While existing methods have shown promise in unconditional single-domain TSG, real-world applications demand for cross-domain approaches capable of controlled generation tailored to domain-specific constraints and instance-level requirements. In this paper, we argue that text can provide semantic insights, domain information and instance-specific temporal patterns, to guide and improve TSG. We introduce ``Text-Controlled TSG'', a task focused on generating realistic time series by incorporating textual descriptions. To address data scarcity in this setting, we propose a novel LLM-based Multi-Agent framework that synthesizes diverse, realistic text-to-TS datasets. Furthermore, we introduce BRIDGE, a hybrid text-controlled TSG framework that integrates semantic prototypes with text description for supporting domain-level guidance. This approach achieves state-of-the-art generation fidelity on 11 of 12 datasets, and improves controllability by 12.52% on MSE and 6.34% MAE compared to no text input generation, highlighting its potential for generating tailored time-series data.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Mitigating mode collapse in normalizing flows by annealing with an adaptive schedule: Application to parameter estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03652v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Normalizing flows (NFs) provide uncorrelated samples from complex distributions, making them an appealing tool for parameter estimation. However, the practical utility of NFs remains limited by their tendency to collapse to a single mode of a multimodal distribution. In this study, we show that annealing with an adaptive schedule based on the effective sample size (ESS) can mitigate mode collapse. We demonstrate that our approach can converge the marginal likelihood for a biochemical oscillator model fit to time-series data in ten-fold less computation time than a widely used ensemble Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. We show that the ESS can also be used to reduce variance by pruning the samples. We expect these developments to be of general use for sampling with NFs and discuss potential opportunities for further improvements.</p></details> | 19 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Survival Analysis with Machine Learning for Predicting Li-ion Battery Remaining Useful Life](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13558v6)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Battery degradation significantly impacts the reliability and efficiency of energy storage systems, particularly in electric vehicles and industrial applications. Predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of lithium-ion batteries is crucial for optimizing maintenance schedules, reducing costs, and improving safety. Traditional RUL prediction methods often struggle with nonlinear degradation patterns and uncertainty quantification. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid survival analysis framework integrating survival data reconstruction, survival model learning, and survival probability estimation. Our approach transforms battery voltage time series into time-to-failure data using path signatures. The multiple Cox-based survival models and machine-learning-based methods, such as DeepHit and MTLR, are learned to predict battery failure-free probabilities over time. Experiments conducted on the Toyota battery and NASA battery datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving high time-dependent AUC and concordance index (C-Index) while maintaining a low integrated Brier score. The data and source codes for this work are available to the public at https://github.com/thinkxca/rul.</p></details> |  |

This paper addresses the memorization phenomenon in time series imputation models, introducing the Loss-Based with Reference Model (LBRM) algorithm. The LBRM method leverages a reference model to enhance the accuracy of membership inference attacks, distinguishing between training and test data. Our contributions are twofold: first, we propose an innovative method to effectively extract and identify memorized training data, significantly improving detection accuracy. On average, without fine-tuning, the AUROC improved by approximately 40\%. With fine-tuning, the AUROC increased by approximately 60\%. Second, we validate our approach through membership inference attacks on two types of architectures designed for time series imputation, demonstrating the robustness and versatility of the LBRM approach in different contexts. These results highlight the significant enhancement in detection accuracy provided by the LBRM approach, addressing privacy risks in time series imputation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Multivariate Time Series Forecasting via Calibrated Language Models with Privileged Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02138v2)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) endeavors to predict future observations given historical data, playing a crucial role in time series data management systems. With advancements in large language models (LLMs), recent studies employ textual prompt tuning to infuse the knowledge of LLMs into MTSF. However, the deployment of LLMs often suffers from low efficiency during the inference phase. To address this problem, we introduce TimeKD, an efficient MTSF framework that leverages the calibrated language models and privileged knowledge distillation. TimeKD aims to generate high-quality future representations from the proposed cross-modality teacher model and cultivate an effective student model. The cross-modality teacher model adopts calibrated language models (CLMs) with ground truth prompts, motivated by the paradigm of Learning Under Privileged Information (LUPI). In addition, we design a subtractive cross attention (SCA) mechanism to refine these representations. To cultivate an effective student model, we propose an innovative privileged knowledge distillation (PKD) mechanism including correlation and feature distillation. PKD enables the student to replicate the teacher's behavior while minimizing their output discrepancy. Extensive experiments on real data offer insight into the effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability of the proposed TimeKD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDE 2025</p></details> |
| **[On the asymptotics of extremal lp-blocks cluster inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13521v4)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extremes occur in stationary regularly varying time series as short periods with several large observations, known as extremal blocks. We study cluster statistics summarizing the behavior of functions acting on these extremal blocks. Examples of cluster statistics are the extremal index, cluster size probabilities, and other cluster indices. The purpose of our work is twofold. First, we state the asymptotic normality of block estimators for cluster inference based on consecutive observations with large lp-norms, for p < 0. The case p=$\alpha$, where $\alpha$ > 0 is the tail index of the time series, has specific nice properties thus we analyze the asymptotic of blocks estimators when approximating $\alpha$ using the Hill estimator. Second, we verify the conditions we require on classical models such as linear models and solutions of stochastic recurrence equations. Regarding linear models, we prove that the asymptotic variance of classical index cluster-based estimators is null as first conjectured in Hsing T. [26]. We illustrate our findings on simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synergizing Large Language Models and Task-specific Models for Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05675v4)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In anomaly detection, methods based on large language models (LLMs) can incorporate expert knowledge by reading professional document, while task-specific small models excel at extracting normal data patterns and detecting value fluctuations from training data of target applications. Inspired by the human nervous system, where the brain stores expert knowledge and the peripheral nervous system and spinal cord handle specific tasks like withdrawal and knee-jerk reflexes, we propose CoLLaTe, a framework designed to facilitate collaboration between LLMs and task-specific models, leveraging the strengths of both models for anomaly detection. In particular, we first formulate the collaboration process and identify two key challenges in the collaboration: (1) the misalignment between the expression domains of the LLMs and task-specific small models, and (2) error accumulation arising from the predictions of both models. To address these challenges, we then introduce two key components in CoLLaTe: a model alignment module and a collaborative loss function. Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we demonstrate that these components effectively mitigate the identified challenges and achieve better performance than both LLM-based and task-specific models.</p></details> |  |

While current research predominantly addresses autocorrelation within historical data, the correlations among future labels are often overlooked. Specifically, modern forecasting models primarily adhere to the Direct Forecast (DF) paradigm, generating multi-step forecasts independently and disregarding label autocorrelation over time. In this work, we demonstrate that the learning objective of DF is biased in the presence of label autocorrelation. To address this issue, we propose the Frequency-enhanced Direct Forecast (FreDF), which mitigates label autocorrelation by learning to forecast in the frequency domain, thereby reducing estimation bias. Our experiments show that FreDF significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods and is compatible with a variety of forecast models.

| **[A Cognitive-Mechanistic Human Reliability Analysis Framework: A Nuclear Power Plant Case Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18604v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional human reliability analysis (HRA) methods, such as IDHEAS-ECA, rely on expert judgment and empirical rules that often overlook the cognitive underpinnings of human error. Moreover, conducting human-in-the-loop experiments for advanced nuclear power plants is increasingly impractical due to novel interfaces and limited operational data. This study proposes a cognitive-mechanistic framework (COGMIF) that enhances the IDHEAS-ECA methodology by integrating an ACT-R-based human digital twin (HDT) with TimeGAN-augmented simulation. The ACT-R model simulates operator cognition, including memory retrieval, goal-directed procedural reasoning, and perceptual-motor execution, under high-fidelity scenarios derived from a high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) simulator. To overcome the resource constraints of large-scale cognitive modeling, TimeGAN is trained on ACT-R-generated time-series data to produce high-fidelity synthetic operator behavior datasets. These simulations are then used to drive IDHEAS-ECA assessments, enabling scalable, mechanism-informed estimation of human error probabilities (HEPs). Comparative analyses with SPAR-H and sensitivity assessments demonstrate the robustness and practical advantages of the proposed COGMIF. Finally, procedural features are mapped onto a Bayesian network to quantify the influence of contributing factors, revealing key drivers of operational risk. This work offers a credible and computationally efficient pathway to integrate cognitive theory into industrial HRA practices.</p></details> |  |

However, while performance gains remain the gold standard for evaluating multimodal systems, concerns around bias and robustness are frequently overlooked. In this context, this paper explores two key research questions (RQs): (i) RQ1 examines whether adding a modality con-sistently enhances performance and investigates its role in shaping fairness measures, assessing whether it mitigates or amplifies bias in multimodal models; (ii) RQ2 investigates the impact of missing modalities at inference time, analyzing how multimodal models generalize in terms of both performance and fairness. Our analysis reveals that incorporating new modalities during training consistently enhances the performance of multimodal models, while fairness trends exhibit variability across different evaluation measures and datasets. Additionally, the absence of modalities at inference degrades performance and fairness, raising concerns about its robustness in real-world deployment. We conduct extensive experiments using multimodal healthcare datasets containing images, time series, and structured information to validate our findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 Second Workshop on Responsible Generative AI</p></details> |

In order to test the inverse model, a synthetic dataset is created by running the model in forward mode with known parameter values to create soil temperature time series that can be used as observations for the inverse model. We show that it is not possible to obtain a reliable parameter estimation using a single observed soil temperature time series. Using measurements at two depths, reliable parameter estimates can be obtained although it is not possible to differentiate between latent and sensible heat fluxes. We apply the inverse model to urban flux tower data in Phoenix, United States, and show that the thermal conductivity, volumetric heat capacity, and the combined sensible-latent heat transfer coefficient can be reliably estimated using an observed value for the effective surface albedo. The resulting model accurately predicts the outgoing longwave radiation, conductive soil fluxes and the combined sensible-latent heat fluxes.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Conversely, casualty ILS are appealing to insurers as an efficient capital management tool. However, securitizing casualty insurance risk is non-trivial, as it requires forecasting loss ratios for pools of insurance policies that have not yet been written, in addition to estimating how the underlying losses will develop over time within future accident years. In this paper, we lay out a Bayesian workflow that tackles these complexities by using: (1) theoretically informed time-series and state-space models to capture how loss ratios develop and change over time; (2) historic industry data to inform prior distributions of models fit to individual programs; (3) stacking to combine loss ratio predictions from candidate models, and (4) both prior predictive simulations and simulation-based calibration to aid model specification. Using historic Schedule P filings, we then show how our proposed Bayesian workflow can be used to assess and compare models across a variety of key model performance metrics evaluated on future accident year losses.</p></details> | 36 pages, 8 figures |

This issue can significantly disrupt systems that rely on the data. Spatial and temporal dependencies can be leveraged to impute the missing samples. Existing imputation methods often ignore dynamic changes in spatial dependencies. We propose a Spatial Dynamic Aware Graph Recurrent Imputation Network (SDA-GRIN) which is capable of capturing dynamic changes in spatial dependencies.SDA-GRIN leverages a multi-head attention mechanism to adapt graph structures with time. SDA-GRIN models multivariate time series as a sequence of temporal graphs and uses a recurrent message-passing architecture for imputation. We evaluate SDA-GRIN on four real-world datasets: SDA-GRIN improves MSE by 9.51% for the AQI and 9.40% for AQI-36. On the PEMS-BAY dataset, it achieves a 1.94% improvement in MSE. Detailed ablation study demonstrates the effect of window sizes and missing data on the performance of the method. Project page:https://ameskandari.github.io/sda-grin/</p></details> |  |

However, no systematic study explains how mechanical design can influence physical computing performance. This study sheds insights into this question by repurposing an origami-inspired modular robotic manipulator into an adaptive physical reservoir and systematically evaluating its computing capacity with different physical configurations, input setups, and computing tasks. By challenging this adaptive reservoir computer to complete the classical NARMA benchmark tasks, this study shows that its time series emulation performance directly correlates to the Peak Similarity Index (PSI), which quantifies the frequency spectrum correlation between the target output and reservoir dynamics. The adaptive reservoir also demonstrates perception capabilities, accurately extracting its payload weight and orientation information from the intrinsic dynamics. Importantly, such information extraction capability can be measured by the spatial correlation between nodal dynamics within the reservoir body. Finally, by integrating shape memory alloy (SMA) actuation, this study demonstrates how to exploit such computing power embodied in the physical body for practical, robotic operations. This study provides a strategic framework for harvesting computing power from soft robots and functional materials, demonstrating how design parameters and input selection can be configured based on computing task requirements. Extending this framework to bio-inspired adaptive materials, prosthetics, and self-adaptive soft robotic systems could enable next-generation embodied intelligence, where the physical structure can compute and interact with their digital counterparts.</p></details> |  |

While previous efforts have focused on enhancing training efficiency through techniques such as gradient descent with momentum, learning rate scheduling, and weight regularization, the demand for further innovation continues to burgeon as model sizes keep expanding. In this study, we introduce a novel framework which diverges from conventional approaches by leveraging long-term time series forecasting techniques. Our method capitalizes solely on initial and final weight values, offering a streamlined alternative for complex model architectures. We also introduce a novel regularizer that is tailored to enhance the forecasting performance of our approach. Empirical evaluations conducted on synthetic weight sequences and real-world deep learning architectures, including the prominent large language model DistilBERT, demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of forecasting accuracy and computational efficiency. Notably, our framework showcases improved performance while requiring minimal additional computational overhead, thus presenting a promising avenue for accelerating the training process across diverse tasks and architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to DASFAA '25</p></details> |

Graphs are generated based on latent positions under the random dot product graph regime. We assign group membership to each node. When evolving through time, the latent position of each node will change based on its current position and two attractors, which are defined to be the centers of the latent positions of all of its neighbors who share its group membership or who have different group membership than it. Parameters are assigned to the attractors to quantify the amount of influence that the attractors have on the trajectory of the latent position of each node. We developed estimators for the parameters, demonstrated their consistency, and established convergence rates under specific assumptions. Through the ABCDPRGM, we provided a novel framework for quantifying and understanding the underlying forces influencing the polarizing or flocking behaviors in dynamic network data.</p></details> |  |

However, this approach lacks temporal constraints when computing temporal features and does not utilize cumulative historical series effectively.To address these limitations, we propose the Structured Channel-wise Transformer with Cumulative Historical state (SCFormer). SCFormer introduces temporal constraints to all linear transformations, including the query, key, and value matrices, as well as the fully connected layers within the Transformer. Additionally, SCFormer employs High-order Polynomial Projection Operators (HiPPO) to deal with cumulative historical time series, allowing the model to incorporate information beyond the look-back window during prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that SCFormer significantly outperforms mainstream baselines, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing time series forecasting.

Seizures disrupt coherence and functional connectivity, necessitating precise detection. Departing from traditional parametric approaches, we utilize the Wold decomposition, representing general time series as autoregressive processes with infinite lags, which are truncated and estimated around the change point. Our detection procedure employs an initial estimator that systematically searches across time points. We examine the localization error and its dependence on time series properties and sample size. To enhance accuracy, we introduce an optimal rate method with an asymptotic distribution, facilitating the construction of confidence intervals. The proposed method effectively identifies seizure onset in EEG data and extends to event detection in video data. Comprehensive numerical experiments demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fixed...</summary><p>Fixed minor typos in V1</p></details> |

Unlike traditional sensor-dependent methods, our approach uses AI-powered vision models to extract lane-specific features, including vehicle count, occupancy, and truck percentage, without relying on costly hardware or complex road modeling. We introduce a novel dataset containing 73,139 lane-wise samples, annotated with four classes of expert-validated anomalies: three traffic-related anomalies (lane blockage and recovery, foreign object intrusion, and sustained congestion) and one sensor-related anomaly (camera angle shift). Our multi-branch detection system integrates deep learning, rule-based logic, and machine learning to improve robustness and precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in precision, recall, and F1-score, providing a cost-effective and scalable solution for real-world intelligent transportation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data Compression for Time Series Modelling: A Case Study of Smart Grid Demand Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02606v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient time series forecasting is essential for smart energy systems, enabling accurate predictions of energy demand, renewable resource availability, and grid stability. However, the growing volume of high-frequency data from sensors and IoT devices poses challenges for storage and transmission. This study explores Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)-based data compression as a solution to these challenges while ensuring forecasting accuracy. A case study of a seawater supply system in Hirtshals, Denmark, operating under dynamic weather, operational schedules, and seasonal trends, is used for evaluation. Biorthogonal wavelets of varying orders were applied to compress data at different rates. Three forecasting models - Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), XGBoost, and the Time Series Dense Encoder (TiDE) - were tested to assess the impact of compression on forecasting performance. Lossy compression rates up to $r_{\mathrm{lossy}} = 0.999$ were analyzed, with the Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) metric quantifying the relationship between compression and information retention. Results indicate that wavelet-based compression can retain essential features for accurate forecasting when applied carefully. XGBoost proved highly robust to compression artifacts, maintaining stable performance across diverse compression rates. In contrast, OLS demonstrated sensitivity to smooth wavelets and high compression rates, while TiDE showed some variability but remained competitive. This study highlights the potential of wavelet-based compression for scalable, efficient data management in smart energy systems without sacrificing forecasting accuracy. The findings are relevant to other fields requiring high-frequency time series forecasting, including climate modeling, water supply systems, and industrial operations.</p></details> |  |

Traditional assignment methods prioritize spatial efficiency, but often overlook behavioral alignment between passengers and drivers, which can significantly impact user satisfaction. MCM addresses this gap by learning personalized passenger comfort zones using gradient-boosted decision tree classifiers trained on labeled ride data, and by modeling driver behavior through empirical operating profiles constructed from time-series driving features. Compatibility between a passenger and a driver is computed as the closed-form volume of intersection between their respective feature-space regions. These compatibility scores are integrated into a utility-based matching algorithm that balances comfort and proximity through a tunable trade-off parameter. We validate the framework using a Unity-based driving simulator with real-time passenger feedback, demonstrating that MCM enables more personalized and socially acceptable matchings while maintaining high levels of operational performance.</p></details> |  |

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a new paradigm for time series analytics by leveraging the shared sequential nature of textual data and time series. However, a fundamental cross-modality gap between time series and LLMs exists, as LLMs are pre-trained on textual corpora and are not inherently optimized for time series. Many recent proposals are designed to address this issue. In this survey, we provide an up-to-date overview of LLMs-based cross-modality modeling for time series analytics. We first introduce a taxonomy that classifies existing approaches into four groups based on the type of textual data employed for time series modeling. We then summarize key cross-modality strategies, e.g., alignment and fusion, and discuss their applications across a range of downstream tasks. Furthermore, we conduct experiments on multimodal datasets from different application domains to investigate effective combinations of textual data and cross-modality strategies for enhancing time series analytics. Finally, we suggest several promising directions for future research. This survey is designed for a range of professionals, researchers, and practitioners interested in LLM-based time series modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2025 Survey Track</p></details> |

Traditional machine learning models exhibit limitations in this forecasting task constrained by their restricted model capacity. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), with their greatly expanded parameter spaces, demonstrate promising potential for modeling complex dependencies in temporal sequences. However, existing LLM-based approaches typically focus on fixed-length patch analysis due to the Transformer architecture, ignoring market data's multi-scale pattern characteristics. In this study, we propose $LLM4FTS$, a novel framework that enhances LLM capabilities for temporal sequence modeling through learnable patch segmentation and dynamic wavelet convolution modules. Specifically,we first employ K-means++ clustering based on DTW distance to identify scale-invariant patterns in market data. Building upon pattern recognition results, we introduce adaptive patch segmentation that partitions temporal sequences while preserving maximal pattern integrity. To accommodate time-varying frequency characteristics, we devise a dynamic wavelet convolution module that emulates discrete wavelet transformation with enhanced flexibility in capturing time-frequency features. These three modules work together to improve large language model's ability to handle scale-invariant patterns in financial time series. Extensive experiments on real-world financial datasets substantiate the framework's efficacy, demonstrating superior performance in capturing complex market patterns and achieving state-of-the-art results in stock return prediction. The successful deployment in practical trading systems confirms its real-world applicability, representing a significant advancement in LLM applications for financial forecasting.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9figures |

Most available estimation methods can be divided into two categories: the covariance-based under asymptotically-identifiable assumption and the autocovariance-based with white idiosyncratic noise. This paper follows the autocovariance-based framework and develops a novel weight-calibrated method to improve the estimation performance. It adopts a linear projection to tackle high-dimensionality, and employs a reduced-rank autoregression formulation. The asymptotic theory of the proposed method is established, relaxing the assumption on white noise. Additionally, we make the first attempt in the literature by providing a systematic theoretical comparison among the covariance-based, the standard autocovariance-based, and our proposed weight-calibrated autocovariance-based methods in the presence of factors with different strengths. Extensive simulations are conducted to showcase the superior finite-sample performance of our proposed method, as well as to validate the newly established theory.

Existing approaches often tightly couple representation learning with specific downstream tasks in an end-to-end manner, failed to analyze the learned representations individually and explicitly, limiting their reusability and generalization. This paper conducts the first systematic comparative study of LOB representation learning, aiming to identify the effective way of extracting transferable, compact features that capture essential LOB properties. We introduce LOBench, a standardized benchmark with real China A-share market data, offering curated datasets, unified preprocessing, consistent evaluation metrics, and strong baselines.

While adversarial defense is well-studied in Computer Vision (CV), the TSC field has primarily relied on adversarial training (AT), which is computationally expensive. In this paper, five data augmentation-based defense methods tailored for time series are developed, with the most computationally intensive method among them increasing the computational resources by only 14.07% compared to the original TSC model. Moreover, the deployment process for these methods is straightforward. By leveraging these advantages of our methods, we create two combined methods. One of these methods is an ensemble of all the proposed techniques, which not only provides better defense performance than PGD-based AT but also enhances the generalization ability of TSC models. Moreover, the computational resources required for our ensemble are less than one-third of those required for PGD-based AT. These methods advance robust TSC in data mining. Furthermore, as foundation models are increasingly explored for time series feature learning, our work provides insights into integrating data augmentation-based adversarial defense with large-scale pre-trained models in future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures.

In addition, the implementation of Transformer variants has improved prediction accuracy. Following these variants, different input data process approaches also enhanced the field, such as tokenization techniques including point-wise, channel-wise, and patch-wise tokenization.

To address these limitations, we introduce a novel CNN Autoencoder-based Score Attention mechanism (CASA), which can be introduced in diverse Transformers model-agnosticically by reducing memory and leading to improvement in model performance. Experiments on eight real-world datasets validate that CASA decreases computational resources by up to 77.7%, accelerates inference by 44.0%, and achieves state-of-the-art performance, ranking first in 87.5% of evaluated metrics.</p></details> |  |

Traditional time-series models, such as ARIMA and GARCH, and recurrent neural networks, like LSTMs, have been widely applied to this task but struggle to capture the regime shifts and long-range dependencies inherent in the data. In this work, we propose CryptoMamba, a novel Mamba-based State Space Model (SSM) architecture designed to effectively capture long-range dependencies in financial time-series data. Our experiments show that CryptoMamba not only provides more accurate predictions but also offers enhanced generalizability across different market conditions, surpassing the limitations of previous models. Coupled with trading algorithms for real-world scenarios, CryptoMamba demonstrates its practical utility by translating accurate forecasts into financial outcomes. Our findings signal a huge advantage for SSMs in stock and cryptocurrency price forecasting tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE International Conference on Blockchain and Cryptocurrency (ICBC) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Scale Graph Learning for Anti-Sparse Downscaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01948v1)** | 2025-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Water temperature can vary substantially even across short distances within the same sub-watershed. Accurate prediction of stream water temperature at fine spatial resolutions (i.e., fine scales, $\leq$ 1 km) enables precise interventions to maintain water quality and protect aquatic habitats. Although spatiotemporal models have made substantial progress in spatially coarse time series modeling, challenges persist in predicting at fine spatial scales due to the lack of data at that scale.To address the problem of insufficient fine-scale data, we propose a Multi-Scale Graph Learning (MSGL) method. This method employs a multi-task learning framework where coarse-scale graph learning, bolstered by larger datasets, simultaneously enhances fine-scale graph learning. Although existing multi-scale or multi-resolution methods integrate data from different spatial scales, they often overlook the spatial correspondences across graph structures at various scales. To address this, our MSGL introduces an additional learning task, cross-scale interpolation learning, which leverages the hydrological connectedness of stream locations across coarse- and fine-scale graphs to establish cross-scale connections, thereby enhancing overall model performance. Furthermore, we have broken free from the mindset that multi-scale learning is limited to synchronous training by proposing an Asynchronous Multi-Scale Graph Learning method (ASYNC-MSGL). Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method for anti-sparse downscaling of daily stream temperatures in the Delaware River Basin, USA, highlighting its potential utility for water resources monitoring and management.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI-...</summary><p>AAAI-25, Multi-scale deep learning approach for spatial downscaling of geospatial data with sparse observations</p></details> |
| **[Granger Causality in High-Dimensional Networks of Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02360v4)** | 2025-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A novel approach is developed for discovering directed connectivity between specified pairs of nodes in a high-dimensional network (HDN) of brain signals. To accurately identify causal connectivity for such specified objectives, it is necessary to properly address the influence of all other nodes within the network. The proposed procedure herein starts with the estimation of a low-dimensional representation of the other nodes in the network utilizing (frequency-domain-based) spectral dynamic principal component analysis (sDPCA). The resulting scores can then be removed from the nodes of interest, thus eliminating the confounding effect of other nodes within the HDN. Accordingly, causal interactions can be dissected between nodes that are isolated from the effects of the network. Extensive simulations have demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach as a tool for causality analysis in complex time series networks. The proposed methodology has also been shown to be applicable to multichannel EEG networks.</p></details> |  |

It enables adaptive, on-demand management of the network based on the objectives of the network operators. In this paper, we propose an innovative three-step framework for intent-driven network management based on Generative AI (GenAI) algorithms. First, we fine-tune a Large Language Model (LLM) on a custom dataset using a Quantized Low-Rank Adapter (QLoRA) to enable memory-efficient intent processing within limited computational resources. A Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) module is included to support dynamic decision-making. Second, we utilize a transformer architecture for time series forecasting to predict key parameters, such as power consumption, traffic load, and packet drop rate, to facilitate intent validation proactively. Lastly, we introduce a Hierarchical Decision Transformer with Goal Awareness (HDTGA) to optimize the selection and orchestration of network applications and hence, optimize the network. Our intent guidance and processing approach improves BERTScore by 6% and the semantic similarity score by 9% compared to the base LLM model. Again, the proposed predictive intent validation approach can successfully rule out the performance-degrading intents with an average of 88% accuracy. Finally, compared to the baselines, the proposed HDTGA algorithm increases throughput at least by 19.3%, reduces delay by 48.5%, and boosts energy efficiency by 54.9%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Curre...</summary><p>Currently under review</p></details> |

This work introduces ForTy, a benchmark for global-scale FORest TYpes mapping using multi-temporal satellite data1. The benchmark comprises 200,000 time series of image patches, each consisting of Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1, climate, and elevation data. Each time series captures variations at monthly or seasonal cadence. Per-pixel annotations, including forest types and other land use classes, support image segmentation tasks. Unlike most existing land use products that often categorize all forest areas into a single class, our benchmark differentiates between three forest types classes: natural forest, planted forest, and tree crops. By leveraging multiple public data sources, we achieve global coverage with this benchmark. We evaluate the forest types dataset using several baseline models, including convolution neural networks and transformer-based models. Additionally, we propose a novel transformer-based model specifically designed to handle multi-modal, multi-temporal satellite data for forest types mapping. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model surpasses the baseline models in performance.</p></details> |  |

However, standard deep learning (DL) struggles to learn generalizable features in low-data environments due to model overfitting. We propose a versatile yet data-efficient framework, Intelligently Augmented Contrastive Tensor Factorization (ITA-CTF), to learn effective representations from multi-dimensional time series. The CTF module learns core explanatory components of the time series (e.g., sensor factors, temporal factors), and importantly, their joint dependencies. Notably, unlike standard tensor factorization (TF), the CTF module incorporates a new contrastive loss optimization to induce similarity learning and class-awareness into the learnt representations for better classification performance. To strengthen this contrastive learning, the preceding ITA module generates targeted but informative augmentations that highlight realistic intra-class patterns in the original data, while preserving class-wise properties. This is achieved by dynamically sampling a "soft" class prototype to guide the warping of each query data sample, which results in an augmentation that is intelligently pattern-mixed between the "soft" class prototype and the query sample. These augmentations enable the CTF module to recognize complex intra-class variations despite the limited original training data, and seek out invariant class-wise properties for accurate classification performance. The proposed method is comprehensively evaluated on five different classification tasks. Compared to standard TF and several DL benchmarks, notable performance improvements up to 18.7% were achieved.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Expert Systems with Applications (DOI pending)</p></details> |

To address these challenges and enhance predictive accuracy, this study introduces a hybrid forecasting framework that integrates the Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Inference System (IT2FIS) with the GARCH model. Leveraging the interval-based uncertainty representation of IT2FIS and the volatility-capturing capability of GARCH, the proposed model effectively mitigates the adverse impact of heteroskedasticity on prediction reliability. Specifically, the GARCH component estimates conditional variance, which is subsequently incorporated into the Gaussian membership functions of IT2FIS. This integration transforms IT2FIS into an adaptive variable-parameter system, dynamically aligning with the time-varying volatility of the target series. Through systematic parameter optimization, the framework not only captures intricate volatility patterns but also accounts for heteroskedasticity and epistemic uncertainties during modeling, thereby improving both prediction precision and model robustness. Experimental validation employs diverse datasets, including air quality concentration, urban traffic flow, and energy consumption. Comparative analyses are conducted against models: the GARCH-Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (GARCH-TSK) model, fixed-variance time series models, the GARCH-Gated Recurrent Unit (GARCH-GRU), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The results indicate that the proposed model achieves superior predictive performance across the majority of test scenarios in error metrics. These findings underscore the effectiveness of hybrid approaches in forecasting uncertainty for GARCH-type time series, highlighting their practical utility in real-world time series forecasting applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 13 figures, references added</p></details> |

Despite progress, existing studies predominantly focus on tasks like financial text summarization, question-answering, and stock movement prediction (binary classification), the application of LLMs to financial risk prediction remains underexplored. Addressing this gap, in this paper, we introduce RiskLabs, a novel framework that leverages LLMs to analyze and predict financial risks. RiskLabs uniquely integrates multimodal financial data, including textual and vocal information from Earnings Conference Calls (ECCs), market-related time series data, and contextual news data to improve financial risk prediction. Empirical results demonstrate RiskLabs' effectiveness in forecasting both market volatility and variance. Through comparative experiments, we examine the contributions of different data sources to financial risk assessment and highlight the crucial role of LLMs in this process. We also discuss the challenges associated with using LLMs for financial risk prediction and explore the potential of combining them with multimodal data for this purpose.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural and Time-Series Approaches for Pricing Weather Derivatives: Performance and Regime Adaptation Using Satellite Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12013v2)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies pricing of weather-derivative (WD) contracts on temperature and precipitation. For temperature-linked strangles in Toronto and Chicago, we benchmark a harmonic-regression/ARMA model against a feed-forward neural network (NN), finding that the NN reduces out-of-sample mean-squared error (MSE) and materially shifts December fair values relative to both the time-series model and the industry-standard Historic Burn Approach (HBA). For precipitation, we employ a compound Poisson--Gamma framework: shape and scale parameters are estimated via maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and via a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on 30-day rainfall sequences spanning multiple seasons. The CNN adaptively learns season-specific $(\alpha,\beta)$ mappings, thereby capturing heterogeneity across regimes that static i.i.d.\ fits miss. At valuation, we assume days are i.i.d.\ $\Gamma(\hat{\alpha},\hat{\beta})$ within each regime and apply a mean-count approximation (replacing the Poisson count by its mean ($n\hat{\lambda}$) to derive closed-form strangle prices. Exploratory analysis of 1981--2023 NASA POWER data confirms pronounced seasonal heterogeneity in $(\alpha,\beta)$ between summer and winter, demonstrating that static global fits are inadequate. Back-testing on Toronto and Chicago grids shows that our regime-adaptive CNN yields competitive valuations and underscores how model choice can shift strangle prices. Payoffs are evaluated analytically when possible and by simulation elsewhere, enabling a like-for-like comparison of forecasting and valuation methods.</p></details> | 23 pages, 31 figures |

A Study on Water Level Forecasting in Everglades](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01415v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Everglades play a crucial role in flood and drought regulation, water resource planning, and ecosystem management in the surrounding regions. However, traditional physics-based and statistical methods for predicting water levels often face significant challenges, including high computational costs and limited adaptability to diverse or unforeseen conditions. Recent advancements in large time series models have demonstrated the potential to address these limitations, with state-of-the-art deep learning and foundation models achieving remarkable success in time series forecasting across various domains. Despite this progress, their application to critical environmental systems, such as the Everglades, remains underexplored. In this study, we fill the gap by investigating twelve task-specific models and five time series foundation models across six categories for a real-world application focused on water level prediction in the Everglades. Our primary results show that the foundation model, Chronos, significantly outperforms all other models while the remaining foundation models exhibit relatively poor performance. Moreover, the performance of task-specific models varies with the model architectures. Lastly, we discuss the possible reasons for the varying performance of models.</p></details> |  |

This study analyzes transportation patterns using two datasets: the NYC Taxi Trip dataset from New York City and the Pathao Food Trip dataset from Dhaka, Bangladesh. Our goal is to identify key trends in demand, peak times, and important geographical hotspots. We start with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the basic characteristics of the datasets. Next, we perform geospatial analysis to map out high-demand and low-demand regions. We use the SARIMAX model for time series analysis to forecast demand patterns, capturing seasonal and weekly variations. Lastly, we apply clustering techniques to identify significant areas of high and low demand. Our findings provide valuable insights for optimizing fleet management and resource allocation in both passenger transport and food delivery services. These insights can help improve service efficiency, better meet customer needs, and enhance urban transportation systems in diverse urban environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting the Price of Gold in the Financial Markets Using Hybrid Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01402v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the price that has the least error and can provide the best and highest accuracy has been one of the most challenging issues and one of the most critical concerns among capital market activists and researchers. Therefore, a model that can solve problems and provide results with high accuracy is one of the topics of interest among researchers. In this project, using time series prediction models such as ARIMA to estimate the price, variables, and indicators related to technical analysis show the behavior of traders involved in involving psychological factors for the model. By linking all of these variables to stepwise regression, we identify the best variables influencing the prediction of the variable. Finally, we enter the selected variables as inputs to the artificial neural network. In other words, we want to call this whole prediction process the "ARIMA_Stepwise Regression_Neural Network" model and try to predict the price of gold in international financial markets. This approach is expected to be able to be used to predict the types of stocks, commodities, currency pairs, financial market indicators, and other items used in local and international financial markets. Moreover, a comparison between the results of this method and time series methods is also expressed. Finally, based on the results, it can be seen that the resulting hybrid model has the highest accuracy compared to the time series method, regression, and stepwise regression.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Emulation of Grey-Box Multi-Model Ensembles Exploiting Known Interior Structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08367v2)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer models are widely used to study complex real world physical systems. However, there are major limitations to their direct use including: their complex structure; large numbers of inputs and outputs; and long evaluation times. Bayesian emulators are an effective means of addressing these challenges providing fast and efficient statistical approximation for computer model outputs. It is commonly assumed that computer models behave like a ``black-box'' function with no knowledge of the output prior to its evaluation. This ensures that emulators are generalisable but potentially limits their accuracy compared with exploiting such knowledge of constrained or structured output behaviour. We assume a ``grey-box'' computer model and develop a methodological toolkit for its analysis. This includes: multi-model ensemble subsampling to identifying a representative model subset to reduce computational expense; constructing a targeted Bayesian design for optimisation or decision support; a ``divide-and-conquer'' approach to emulating sums of outputs; structured emulators exploiting known constrained and structured behaviour of constituent outputs through splitting the parameter space and imposing truncations; emulation of sums of time series outputs; and emulation of multi-model ensemble outputs. Combining these methods establishes a hierarchical emulation framework which achieves greater physical interpretability and more accurate emulator predictions. This research is motivated by and applied to the commercially important TNO OLYMPUS Well Control Optimisation Challenge from the petroleum industry which we re-express as a decision support under uncertainty problem. We thus encourage users to examine their ``black-box'' simulators to achieve superior emulator accuracy.</p></details> | 50 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Early Detection of Patient Deterioration from Real-Time Wearable Monitoring System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01305v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early detection of patient deterioration is crucial for reducing mortality rates. Heart rate data has shown promise in assessing patient health, and wearable devices offer a cost-effective solution for real-time monitoring. However, extracting meaningful insights from diverse heart rate data and handling missing values in wearable device data remain key challenges. To address these challenges, we propose TARL, an innovative approach that models the structural relationships of representative subsequences, known as shapelets, in heart rate time series. TARL creates a shapelet-transition knowledge graph to model shapelet dynamics in heart rate time series, indicating illness progression and potential future changes. We further introduce a transition-aware knowledge embedding to reinforce relationships among shapelets and quantify the impact of missing values, enabling the formulation of comprehensive heart rate representations. These representations capture explanatory structures and predict future heart rate trends, aiding early illness detection. We collaborate with physicians and nurses to gather ICU patient heart rate data from wearables and diagnostic metrics assessing illness severity for evaluating deterioration. Experiments on real-world ICU data demonstrate that TARL achieves both high reliability and early detection. A case study further showcases TARL's explainable detection process, highlighting its potential as an AI-driven tool to assist clinicians in recognizing early signs of patient deterioration.</p></details> |  |
| **[DConAD: A Differencing-based Contrastive Representation Learning Framework for Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14204v2)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection holds notable importance for risk identification and fault detection across diverse application domains. Unsupervised learning methods have become popular because they have no requirement for labels. However, due to the challenges posed by the multiplicity of abnormal patterns, the sparsity of anomalies, and the growth of data scale and complexity, these methods often fail to capture robust and representative dependencies within the time series for identifying anomalies. To enhance the ability of models to capture normal patterns of time series and avoid the retrogression of modeling ability triggered by the dependencies on high-quality prior knowledge, we propose a differencing-based contrastive representation learning framework for time series anomaly detection (DConAD). Specifically, DConAD generates differential data to provide additional information about time series and utilizes transformer-based architecture to capture spatiotemporal dependencies, which enhances the robustness of unbiased representation learning ability. Furthermore, DConAD implements a novel KL divergence-based contrastive learning paradigm that only uses positive samples to avoid deviation from reconstruction and deploys the stop-gradient strategy to compel convergence. Extensive experiments on five public datasets show the superiority and effectiveness of DConAD compared with nine baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/shaieesss/DConAD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Empirical Comparison of Lightweight Forecasting Models for Seasonal and Non-Seasonal Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01163v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate time series forecasting is essential in many real-time applications that demand both high predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. This study provides an empirical comparison between a Polynomial Classifier and a Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) across four real-world time series datasets (weather conditions, gold prices, crude oil prices, and beer production volumes) that cover both seasonal and nonseasonal patterns. Model performance is evaluated by forecasting accuracy (using Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error, and Coefficient of Variation of Root Mean Squared Error) and computational time to assess each model's viability for real time forecasting. The results show that the PC yields more accurate and faster forecasts for non seasonal series, whereas the RBFNN performs better on series with pronounced seasonal patterns. From an interpretability standpoint, the polynomial model offers a simpler, more transparent structure (in contrast to the black box nature of neural network), which is advantageous for understanding and trust in real time decision making. The performance differences between PC and RBFNN are statistically significant, as confirmed by paired t tests and Wilcoxon signed rank tests. These findings provide practical guidance for model selection in time series forecasting, indicating that PC may be preferable for quick, interpretable forecasts in non-seasonal contexts, whereas RBFNN is superior for capturing complex seasonal behaviors</p></details> |  |

Recent studies have revealed that multimodal models can address the core issue by integrating textual information. However, these models focus on either historical or future textual information, overlooking the unique contributions each plays in time series forecasting. Besides, these models fail to grasp the intricate relationships between textual and time series data, constrained by their moderate capacity for multimodal comprehension. To tackle these challenges, we propose Dual-Forecaster, a pioneering multimodal time series model that combines both descriptively historical textual information and predictive textual insights, leveraging advanced multimodal comprehension capability empowered by three well-designed cross-modality alignment techniques. Our comprehensive evaluations on fifteen multimodal time series datasets demonstrate that Dual-Forecaster is a distinctly effective multimodal time series model that outperforms or is comparable to other state-of-the-art models, highlighting the superiority of integrating textual information for time series forecasting. This work opens new avenues in the integration of textual information with numerical time series data for multimodal time series analysis.</p></details> |  |

I propose to generalize RUC into a model agnostic feature optimization framework for multivariate time series forecasting. The core idea is to synthesize candidate feature programs by randomly composing operators from a domain specific grammar, score candidates rapidly with inexpensive surrogate models on rolling windows, and filter instability via nested cross validation and information theoretic shrinkage. By decoupling feature discovery from GPU heavy deep learning, the method promises faster iteration cycles, lower energy consumption, and greater interpretability. Societal relevance: accurate, transparent forecasting tools empower resource constrained institutions, energy regulators, climate risk NGOs to make data driven decisions without proprietary black box models.</p></details> |  |

Most LDP methods assume that users possess only a single data record, which is a significant limitation since users often gather extensive datasets (e.g., images, text, time-series data) and frequently have access to public datasets. To address this limitation, we propose a locally private sampling framework that leverages both the private and public datasets of each user. Specifically, we assume each user has two distributions: $p$ and $q$ that represent their private dataset and the public dataset, respectively. The objective is to design a mechanism that generates a private sample approximating $p$ while simultaneously preserving $q$. We frame this objective as a minimax optimization problem using $f$-divergence as the utility measure. We fully characterize the minimax optimal mechanisms for general $f$-divergences provided that $p$ and $q$ are discrete distributions. Remarkably, we demonstrate that this optimal mechanism is universal across all $f$-divergences. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our minimax optimal sampler compared to the state-of-the-art locally private sampler.</p></details> |  |
| **[FreCT: Frequency-augmented Convolutional Transformer for Robust Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00941v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection is critical for system monitoring and risk identification, across various domains, such as finance and healthcare. However, for most reconstruction-based approaches, detecting anomalies remains a challenge due to the complexity of sequential patterns in time series data. On the one hand, reconstruction-based techniques are susceptible to computational deviation stemming from anomalies, which can lead to impure representations of normal sequence patterns. On the other hand, they often focus on the time-domain dependencies of time series, while ignoring the alignment of frequency information beyond the time domain. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Frequency-augmented Convolutional Transformer (FreCT). FreCT utilizes patch operations to generate contrastive views and employs an improved Transformer architecture integrated with a convolution module to capture long-term dependencies while preserving local topology information. The introduced frequency analysis based on Fourier transformation could enhance the model's ability to capture crucial characteristics beyond the time domain. To protect the training quality from anomalies and improve the robustness, FreCT deploys stop-gradient Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and absolute error to optimize consistency information in both time and frequency domains. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that FreCT outperforms existing methods in identifying anomalies.</p></details> |  |

However, ensuring the dynamical stability of NGRC models during autonomous prediction remains a challenge. In this work, we uncover a key connection between the numerical conditioning of the NGRC feature matrix -- formed by polynomial evaluations on time-delay coordinates -- and the long-term NGRC dynamics. Merging tools from numerical linear algebra and ergodic theory of dynamical systems, we systematically study how the feature matrix conditioning varies across hyperparameters. We demonstrate that the NGRC feature matrix tends to be ill-conditioned for short time lags and high-degree polynomials. Ill-conditioning amplifies sensitivity to training data perturbations, which can produce unstable NGRC dynamics. We evaluate the impact of different numerical algorithms (Cholesky, SVD, and LU) for solving the regularized least-squares problem.</p></details> | 21 pages, 8 figures |

In this paper, we present a multimodal evaluation of the affective and physiological impacts of three auditory conditions, that is, spiritual meditation (SM), music (M), and natural silence (NS), using a comprehensive suite of biometric signal measures. To facilitate this analysis, we introduce the Spiritual, Music, Silence Acoustic Time Series (SMSAT) dataset, a novel benchmark comprising acoustic time series (ATS) signals recorded under controlled exposure protocols, with careful attention to demographic diversity and experimental consistency. To model the auditory induced states, we develop a contrastive learning based SMSAT audio encoder that extracts highly discriminative embeddings from ATS data, achieving 99.99% classification accuracy in interclass and intraclass evaluations. Furthermore, we propose the Calmness Analysis Model (CAM), a deep learning framework integrating 25 handcrafted and learned features for affective state classification across auditory conditions, attaining robust 99.99% classification accuracy. In contrast, pairwise t tests reveal significant deviations in cardiac response characteristics (CRC) between SM analysis via ANOVA inducing more significant physiological fluctuations. Compared to existing state of the art methods reporting accuracies up to 90%, the proposed model demonstrates substantial performance gains (up to 99%). This work contributes a validated multimodal dataset and a scalable deep learning framework for affective computing applications in stress monitoring, mental well-being, and therapeutic audio-based interventions.</p></details> |  |

Our study focuses on modelling extreme skew surges along the French Atlantic coast, with a particular emphasis on investigating the extremal dependence structure between stations. We employ the peak-over-threshold framework, where a multivariate extreme event is defined whenever at least one location records a large value, though not necessarily all stations simultaneously. A novel method for determining an appropriate level (threshold) above which observations can be classified as extreme is proposed. Two complementary approaches are explored. First, the multivariate generalized Pareto distribution is employed to model extremes, leveraging its properties to derive a generative model that predicts extreme skew surges at one station based on observed extremes at nearby stations. Second, a novel extreme regression framework is assessed for point predictions. This specific regression framework enables accurate point predictions using only the "angle" of input variables, i.e. input variables divided by their norms. The ultimate objective is to reconstruct historical skew surge time series at stations with limited data. This is achieved by integrating extreme skew surge data from stations with longer records, such as Brest and Saint-Nazaire, which provide over 150 years of observations.</p></details> |  |

A crucial component in developing a reliable prediction model is collecting high-quality time series clinical events. In this work, we release such a dataset that consists of 22,588,586 Clinical Time Series events, which we term MIMIC-\RNum{4}-Ext-22MCTS. Our source data are discharge summaries selected from the well-known yet unstructured MIMIC-IV-Note \cite{Johnson2023-pg}. We then extract clinical events as short text span from the discharge summaries, along with the timestamps of these events as temporal information. The general-purpose MIMIC-IV-Note pose specific challenges for our work: it turns out that the discharge summaries are too lengthy for typical natural language models to process, and the clinical events of interest often are not accompanied with explicit timestamps. Therefore, we propose a new framework that works as follows: 1) we break each discharge summary into manageably small text chunks; 2) we apply contextual BM25 and contextual semantic search to retrieve chunks that have a high potential of containing clinical events; and 3) we carefully design prompts to teach the recently released Llama-3.1-8B \cite{touvron2023llama} model to identify or infer temporal information of the chunks. We show that the obtained dataset is so informative and transparent that standard models fine-tuned on our dataset are achieving significant improvements in healthcare applications. In particular, the BERT model fine-tuned based on our dataset achieves 10\% improvement in accuracy on medical question answering task, and 3\% improvement in clinical trial matching task compared with the classic BERT. The GPT-2 model, fine-tuned on our dataset, produces more clinically reliable results for clinical questions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unlocking the Potential of Linear Networks for Irregular Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00590v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting holds significant importance across various industries, including finance, transportation, energy, healthcare, and climate. Despite the widespread use of linear networks due to their low computational cost and effectiveness in modeling temporal dependencies, most existing research has concentrated on regularly sampled and fully observed multivariate time series. However, in practice, we frequently encounter irregular multivariate time series characterized by variable sampling intervals and missing values. The inherent intra-series inconsistency and inter-series asynchrony in such data hinder effective modeling and forecasting with traditional linear networks relying on static weights. To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces a novel model named AiT. AiT utilizes an adaptive linear network capable of dynamically adjusting weights according to observation time points to address intra-series inconsistency, thereby enhancing the accuracy of temporal dependencies modeling. Furthermore, by incorporating the Transformer module on variable semantics embeddings, AiT efficiently captures variable correlations, avoiding the challenge of inter-series asynchrony. Comprehensive experiments across four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of AiT, improving prediction accuracy by 11% and decreasing runtime by 52% compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[KnowEEG: Explainable Knowledge Driven EEG Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00541v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalography (EEG) is a method of recording brain activity that shows significant promise in applications ranging from disease classification to emotion detection and brain-computer interfaces. Recent advances in deep learning have improved EEG classification performance yet model explainability remains an issue. To address this key limitation of explainability we introduce KnowEEG; a novel explainable machine learning approach for EEG classification. KnowEEG extracts a comprehensive set of per-electrode features, filters them using statistical tests, and integrates between-electrode connectivity statistics. These features are then input to our modified Random Forest model (Fusion Forest) that balances per electrode statistics with between electrode connectivity features in growing the trees of the forest. By incorporating knowledge from both the generalized time-series and EEG-specific domains, KnowEEG achieves performance comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art deep learning models across five different classification tasks: emotion detection, mental workload classification, eyes open/closed detection, abnormal EEG classification, and event detection. In addition to high performance, KnowEEG provides inherent explainability through feature importance scores for understandable features. We demonstrate by example on the eyes closed/open classification task that this explainability can be used to discover knowledge about the classes. This discovered knowledge for eyes open/closed classification was proven to be correct by current neuroscience literature. Therefore, the impact of KnowEEG will be significant for domains where EEG explainability is critical such as healthcare.</p></details> |  |
