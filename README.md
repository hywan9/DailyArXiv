| **[No $D_{\text{train}}$: Model-Agnostic Counterfactual Explanations Using Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18563v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning (ML) methods have experienced significant growth in the past decade, yet their practical application in high-impact real-world domains has been hindered by their opacity. When ML methods are responsible for making critical decisions, stakeholders often require insights into how to alter these decisions. Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) have emerged as a solution, offering interpretations of opaque ML models and providing a pathway to transition from one decision to another. However, most existing CFE methods require access to the model's training dataset, few methods can handle multivariate time-series, and none of model-agnostic CFE methods can handle multivariate time-series without training datasets. These limitations can be formidable in many scenarios. In this paper, we present NTD-CFE, a novel model-agnostic CFE method based on reinforcement learning (RL) that generates CFEs when training datasets are unavailable. NTD-CFE is suitable for both static and multivariate time-series datasets with continuous and discrete features. NTD-CFE reduces the CFE search space from a multivariate time-series domain to a lower dimensional space and addresses the problem using RL. Users have the flexibility to specify non-actionable, immutable, and preferred features, as well as causal constraints. We demonstrate the performance of NTD-CFE against four baselines on several datasets and find that, despite not having access to a training dataset, NTD-CFE finds CFEs that make significantly fewer and significantly smaller changes to the input time-series. These properties make CFEs more actionable, as the magnitude of change required to alter an outcome is vastly reduced. The code is available in the supplementary material.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Causal Discovery for Autoregressive Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07898v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we present a novel constraint-based algorithm for causal structure learning specifically designed for nonlinear autoregressive time series. Our algorithm significantly reduces computational complexity compared to existing methods, making it more efficient and scalable to larger problems. We rigorously evaluate its performance on synthetic datasets, demonstrating that our algorithm not only outperforms current techniques, but also excels in scenarios with limited data availability. These results highlight its potential for practical applications in fields requiring efficient and accurate causal inference from nonlinear time series data.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |
| **[On the capabilities of LLMs for classifying and segmenting time series of fruit picking motions into primitive actions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07745v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their recent introduction to human society, Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly affected the way we tackle mental challenges in our everyday lives. From optimizing our linguistic communication to assisting us in making important decisions, LLMs, such as ChatGPT, are notably reducing our cognitive load by gradually taking on an increasing share of our mental activities. In the context of Learning by Demonstration (LbD), classifying and segmenting complex motions into primitive actions, such as pushing, pulling, twisting etc, is considered to be a key-step towards encoding a task. In this work, we investigate the capabilities of LLMs to undertake this task, considering a finite set of predefined primitive actions found in fruit picking operations. By utilizing LLMs instead of simple supervised learning or analytic methods, we aim at making the method easily applicable and deployable in a real-life scenario. Three different fine-tuning approaches are investigated, compared on datasets captured kinesthetically, using a UR10e robot, during a fruit-picking scenario.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is a Late Breaking Results report and it will be presented through a poster at the 34th IEEE International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (ROMAN), 2025 at Eindhoven, the Netherlands</p></details> |
| **[Action Unit Enhance Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07678v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition(DFER) is a rapidly evolving field of research that focuses on the recognition of time-series facial expressions. While previous research on DFER has concentrated on feature learning from a deep learning perspective, we put forward an AU-enhanced Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition architecture, namely AU-DFER, that incorporates AU-expression knowledge to enhance the effectiveness of deep learning modeling. In particular, the contribution of the Action Units(AUs) to different expressions is quantified, and a weight matrix is designed to incorporate a priori knowledge. Subsequently, the knowledge is integrated with the learning outcomes of a conventional deep learning network through the introduction of AU loss. The design is incorporated into the existing optimal model for dynamic expression recognition for the purpose of validation. Experiments are conducted on three recent mainstream open-source approaches to DFER on the principal datasets in this field. The results demonstrate that the proposed architecture outperforms the state-of-the-art(SOTA) methods without the need for additional arithmetic and generally produces improved results. Furthermore, we investigate the potential of AU loss function redesign to address data label imbalance issues in established dynamic expression datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate quantified AU-expression knowledge into various DFER models. We also devise strategies to tackle label imbalance, or minor class problems. Our findings suggest that employing a diverse strategy of loss function design can enhance the effectiveness of DFER. This underscores the criticality of addressing data imbalance challenges in mainstream datasets within this domain.

| **[A Novel Hybrid Approach for Time Series Forecasting: Period Estimation and Climate Data Analysis Using Unsupervised Learning and Spline Interpolation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07652v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article explores a novel approach to time series forecasting applied to the context of Chennai's climate data. Our methodology comprises two distinct established time series models, leveraging their strengths in handling seasonality and periods. Notably, a new algorithm is developed to compute the period of the time series using unsupervised machine learning and spline interpolation techniques. Through a meticulous ensembling process that combines these two models, we achieve optimized forecasts. This research contributes to advancing forecasting techniques and offers valuable insights into climate data analysis.</p></details> | 17 Pages, 13 figures |
| **[Functional Time Series Forecasting of Distributions: A Koopman-Wasserstein Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07570v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel method for forecasting the temporal evolution of probability distributions observed at discrete time points. Extending the Dynamic Probability Density Decomposition (DPDD), we embed distributional dynamics into Wasserstein geometry via a Koopman operator framework. Our approach introduces an importance-weighted variant of Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD), enabling accurate, closed-form forecasts in 2-Wasserstein space. Theoretical guarantees are established: our estimator achieves spectral convergence and optimal finite-sample Wasserstein error. Simulation studies and a real-world application to U.S. housing price distributions show substantial improvements over existing methods such as Wasserstein Autoregression. By integrating optimal transport, functional time series modeling, and spectral operator theory, DPDD offers a scalable and interpretable solution for distributional forecasting. This work has broad implications for behavioral science, public health, finance, and neuroimaging--domains where evolving distributions arise naturally. Our framework contributes to functional data analysis on non-Euclidean spaces and provides a general tool for modeling and forecasting distributional time series.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review for Behaviormetrika</p></details> |
| **[Real-Time Decorrelation-Based Anomaly Detection for Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07559v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection (AD) plays a vital role across a wide range of real-world domains by identifying data instances that deviate from expected patterns, potentially signaling critical events such as system failures, fraudulent activities, or rare medical conditions. The demand for real-time AD has surged with the rise of the (Industrial) Internet of Things, where massive volumes of multivariate sensor data must be processed instantaneously. Real-time AD requires methods that not only handle high-dimensional streaming data but also operate in a single-pass manner, without the burden of storing historical instances, thereby ensuring minimal memory usage and fast decision-making. We propose DAD, a novel real-time decorrelation-based anomaly detection method for multivariate time series, based on an online decorrelation learning approach. Unlike traditional proximity-based or reconstruction-based detectors that process entire data or windowed instances, DAD dynamically learns and monitors the correlation structure of data sample by sample in a single pass, enabling efficient and effective detection. To support more realistic benchmarking practices, we also introduce a practical hyperparameter tuning strategy tailored for real-time anomaly detection scenarios. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that DAD achieves the most consistent and superior performance across diverse anomaly types compared to state-of-the-art methods. Crucially, its robustness to increasing dimensionality makes it particularly well-suited for real-time, high-dimensional data streams. Ultimately, DAD not only strikes an optimal balance between detection efficacy and computational efficiency but also sets a new standard for real-time, memory-constrained anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Don't Get Me Wrong: How to Apply Deep Visual Interpretations to Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07861v3)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The correct interpretation of convolutional models is a hard problem for time series data. While saliency methods promise visual validation of predictions for image and language processing, they fall short when applied to time series. These tend to be less intuitive and represent highly diverse data, such as the tool-use time series dataset. Furthermore, saliency methods often generate varied, conflicting explanations, complicating the reliability of these methods. Consequently, a rigorous objective assessment is necessary to establish trust in them. This paper investigates saliency methods on time series data to formulate recommendations for interpreting convolutional models and implements them on the tool-use time series problem. To achieve this, we first employ nine gradient-, propagation-, or perturbation-based post-hoc saliency methods across six varied and complex real-world datasets. Next, we evaluate these methods using five independent metrics to generate recommendations. Subsequently, we implement a case study focusing on tool-use time series using convolutional classification models. Our results validate our recommendations that indicate that none of the saliency methods consistently outperforms others on all metrics, while some are sometimes ahead. Our insights and step-by-step guidelines allow experts to choose suitable saliency methods for a given model and dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>48 pa...</summary><p>48 pages, 12 figues, 7 tables, 6 algorithms</p></details> |
| **[Galerkin-ARIMA: A Two-Stage Polynomial Regression Framework for Fast Rolling One-Step-Ahead Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07469v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series models like ARIMA remain widely used for forecasting but limited to linear assumptions and high computational cost in large and complex datasets. We propose Galerkin-ARIMA that generalizes the AR component of ARIMA and replace it with a flexible spline-based function estimated by Galerkin projection. This enables the model to capture nonlinear dependencies in lagged values and retain the MA component and Gaussian noise assumption. We derive a closed-form OLS estimator for the Galerkin coefficients and show the model is asymptotically unbiased and consistent under standard conditions. Our method bridges classical time-series modeling and nonparametric regression, which offering improved forecasting performance and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[C3T: Cross-modal Transfer Through Time for Sensor-based Human Activity Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16803v4)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In order to unlock the potential of diverse sensors, we investigate a method to transfer knowledge between time-series modalities using a multimodal \textit{temporal} representation space for Human Activity Recognition (HAR). Specifically, we explore the setting where the modality used in testing has no labeled data during training, which we refer to as Unsupervised Modality Adaptation (UMA). We categorize existing UMA approaches as Student-Teacher or Contrastive Alignment methods. These methods typically compress continuous-time data samples into single latent vectors during alignment, inhibiting their ability to transfer temporal information through real-world temporal distortions. To address this, we introduce Cross-modal Transfer Through Time (C3T), which preserves temporal information during alignment to handle dynamic sensor data better. C3T achieves this by aligning a set of temporal latent vectors across sensing modalities. Our extensive experiments on various camera+IMU datasets demonstrate that C3T outperforms existing methods in UMA by at least 8% in accuracy and shows superior robustness to temporal distortions such as time-shift, misalignment, and dilation. Our findings suggest that C3T has significant potential for developing generalizable models for time-series sensor data, opening new avenues for various multimodal applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Interpretable Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07439v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate the distillation of time series reasoning capabilities into small, instruction-tuned language models as a step toward building interpretable time series foundation models. Leveraging a synthetic dataset of mean-reverting time series with systematically varied trends and noise levels, we generate natural language annotations using a large multimodal model and use these to supervise the fine-tuning of compact Qwen models. We introduce evaluation metrics that assess the quality of the distilled reasoning - focusing on trend direction, noise intensity, and extremum localization - and show that the post-trained models acquire meaningful interpretive capabilities. Our results highlight the feasibility of compressing time series understanding into lightweight, language-capable models suitable for on-device or privacy-sensitive deployment. This work contributes a concrete foundation toward developing small, interpretable models that explain temporal patterns in natural language.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Machine Leaning (ICML) 2025 Workshop on Foundation Models for Structured Data</p></details> |
| **[Structural Classification of Locally Stationary Time Series Based on Second-order Characteristics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04237v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series classification is crucial for numerous scientific and engineering applications. In this article, we present a numerically efficient, practically competitive, and theoretically rigorous classification method for distinguishing between two classes of locally stationary time series based on their time-domain, second-order characteristics. Our approach builds on the autoregressive approximation for locally stationary time series, combined with an ensemble aggregation and a distance-based threshold for classification. It imposes no requirement on the training sample size, and is shown to achieve zero misclassification error rate asymptotically when the underlying time series differ only mildly in their second-order characteristics. The new method is demonstrated to outperform a variety of state-of-the-art solutions, including wavelet-based, tree-based, convolution-based methods, as well as modern deep learning methods, through intensive numerical simulations and a real EEG data analysis for epilepsy classification.</p></details> | 41 Pages, 4 Figures |
| **[From Images to Signals: Are Large Vision Models Useful for Time Series Analysis?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24030v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based models have gained increasing attention in time series research, driving interest in Large Language Models (LLMs) and foundation models for time series analysis. As the field moves toward multi-modality, Large Vision Models (LVMs) are emerging as a promising direction. In the past, the effectiveness of Transformer and LLMs in time series has been debated. When it comes to LVMs, a similar question arises: are LVMs truely useful for time series analysis? To address it, we design and conduct the first principled study involving 4 LVMs, 8 imaging methods, 18 datasets and 26 baselines across both high-level (classification) and low-level (forecasting) tasks, with extensive ablation analysis. Our findings indicate LVMs are indeed useful for time series classification but face challenges in forecasting. Although effective, the contemporary best LVM forecasters are limited to specific types of LVMs and imaging methods, exhibit a bias toward forecasting periods, and have limited ability to utilize long look-back windows. We hope our findings could serve as a cornerstone for future research on LVM- and multimodal-based solutions to different time series tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time Series Foundation Models for Multivariate Financial Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07296v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Financial time series forecasting presents significant challenges due to complex nonlinear relationships, temporal dependencies, variable interdependencies and limited data availability, particularly for tasks involving low-frequency data, newly listed instruments, or emerging market assets. Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) offer a promising solution through pretraining on diverse time series corpora followed by task-specific adaptation. This study evaluates two TSFMs (Tiny Time Mixers (TTM) and Chronos) across three financial forecasting tasks: US 10-year Treasury yield changes, EUR/USD volatility, and equity spread prediction. Results demonstrate that TTM exhibits strong transferability. When fine-tuning both the pretrained version of TTM and an untrained model with the same architecture, the pretrained version achieved 25-50% better performance when fine-tuned on limited data and 15-30% improvements even when fine-tuned on lengthier datasets. Notably, TTM's zero-shot performance outperformed naive benchmarks in volatility forecasting and equity spread prediction, with the latter demonstrating that TSFMs can surpass traditional benchmark models without fine-tuning. The pretrained model consistently required 3-10 fewer years of data to achieve comparable performance levels compared to the untrained model, demonstrating significant sample-efficiency gains. However, while TTM outperformed naive baselines, traditional specialised models matched or exceeded its performance in two of three tasks, suggesting TSFMs prioritise breadth over task-specific optimisation. These findings indicate that TSFMs, though still nascent, offer substantial promise for financial forecasting-particularly in noisy, data-constrained tasks-but achieving competitive performance likely requires domain-specific pretraining and architectural refinements tailored to financial time series characteristics.</p></details> | 66 pages |
| **[Bridging the Last Mile of Prediction: Enhancing Time Series Forecasting with Conditional Guided Flow Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07192v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models, a type of generative model, have shown promise in time series forecasting. But they face limitations like rigid source distributions and limited sampling paths, which hinder their performance. Flow matching offers faster generation, higher-quality outputs, and greater flexibility, while also possessing the ability to utilize valuable information from the prediction errors of prior models, which were previously inaccessible yet critically important. To address these challenges and fully unlock the untapped potential of flow matching, we propose Conditional Guided Flow Matching (CGFM). CGFM extends flow matching by incorporating the outputs of an auxiliary model, enabling a previously unattainable capability in the field: learning from the errors of the auxiliary model. For time series forecasting tasks, it integrates historical data as conditions and guidance, constructs two-sided conditional probability paths, and uses a general affine path to expand the space of probability paths, ultimately leading to improved predictions. Extensive experiments show that CGFM consistently enhances and outperforms state-of-the-art models, highlighting its effectiveness in advancing forecasting methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating Multi-Table Time Series EHR from Latent Space with Minimal Preprocessing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06996v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electronic Health Records (EHR) are time-series relational databases that record patient interactions and medical events over time, serving as a critical resource for healthcare research and applications. However, privacy concerns and regulatory restrictions limit the sharing and utilization of such sensitive data, necessitating the generation of synthetic EHR datasets. Unlike previous EHR synthesis methods, which typically generate medical records consisting of expert-chosen features (e.g. a few vital signs or structured codes only), we introduce RawMed, the first framework to synthesize multi-table, time-series EHR data that closely resembles raw EHRs. Using text-based representation and compression techniques, RawMed captures complex structures and temporal dynamics with minimal preprocessing. We also propose a new evaluation framework for multi-table time-series synthetic EHRs, assessing distributional similarity, inter-table relationships, temporal dynamics, and privacy. Validated on two open-source EHR datasets, RawMed outperforms baseline models in fidelity and utility. The code is available at https://github.com/eunbyeol-cho/RawMed.</p></details> |  |

| **[The cost of ensembling: is it always worth combining?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04677v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the continuous increase in dataset sizes and the complexity of forecasting models, the trade-off between forecast accuracy and computational cost is emerging as an extremely relevant topic, especially in the context of ensemble learning for time series forecasting. To asses it, we evaluated ten base models and eight ensemble configurations across two large-scale retail datasets (M5 and VN1), considering both point and probabilistic accuracy under varying retraining frequencies. We showed that ensembles consistently improve forecasting performance, particularly in probabilistic settings. However, these gains come at a substantial computational cost, especially for larger, accuracy-driven ensembles. We found that reducing retraining frequency significantly lowers costs, with minimal impact on accuracy, particularly for point forecasts. Moreover, efficiency-driven ensembles offer a strong balance, achieving competitive accuracy with considerably lower costs compared to accuracy-optimized combinations. Most importantly, small ensembles of two or three models are often sufficient to achieve near-optimal results. These findings provide practical guidelines for deploying scalable and cost-efficient forecasting systems, supporting the broader goals of sustainable AI in forecasting. Overall, this work shows that careful ensemble design and retraining strategy selection can yield accurate, robust, and cost-effective forecasts suitable for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

The proposed approach is validated from various perspectives using simulations. This method is a competitor to that of Pettitt ([3]) and is, like the latter, based on the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. It is used in [4] for the study of relatively short time series obtained from measurements on cores sampled in the bay of Brest.</p></details> |  |
| **[Elite Polarization in European Parliamentary Speeches: a Novel Measurement Approach Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06658v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This project introduces a new measure of elite polarization via actor and subject detection using artificial intelligence. I identify when politicians mention one another in parliamentary speeches, note who is speaking and who is being addressed, and assess the emotional temperature behind these evaluations. This maps how elites evaluate their various out-parties, allowing us to create an index of mutual out-party hostility, that is, elite polarization. While I analyzed polarization data over the past four decades for the UK, and two decades for Hungary and Italy, my approach lays the groundwork for a twenty-year, EU-wide time-series dataset on elite polarization. I obtain the results that can be aggregated by party and quarter. The resulting index demonstrates a good face validity: it reacts to events such as electoral campaigns, country- and party-level crises, and to parties losing and assuming power.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sparsity-Promoting Dynamic Mode Decomposition Applied to Sea Surface Temperature Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05711v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we leverage Koopman mode decomposition to analyze the nonlinear and high-dimensional climate systems acting on the observed data space. The dynamics of atmospheric systems are assumed to be equation-free, with the linear evolution of observables derived from measured historical long-term time-series data snapshots, such as monthly sea surface temperature records, to construct a purely data-driven climate dynamics. In particular, sparsity-promoting dynamic mode decomposition is exploited to extract the dominant spatial and temporal modes, which are among the most significant coherent structures underlying climate variability, enabling a more efficient, interpretable, and low-dimensional representation of the system dynamics. We hope that the combined use of Koopman modes and sparsity-promoting techniques will provide insights into the significant climate modes, enabling reduced-order modeling of the climate system and offering a potential framework for predicting and controlling weather and climate variability.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[MoFE-Time: Mixture of Frequency Domain Experts for Time-Series Forecasting Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06502v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a prominent data modality task, time series forecasting plays a pivotal role in diverse applications. With the remarkable advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), the adoption of LLMs as the foundational architecture for time series modeling has gained significant attention. Although existing models achieve some success, they rarely both model time and frequency characteristics in a pretraining-finetuning paradigm leading to suboptimal performance in predictions of complex time series, which requires both modeling periodicity and prior pattern knowledge of signals. We propose MoFE-Time, an innovative time series forecasting model that integrates time and frequency domain features within a Mixture of Experts (MoE) network. Moreover, we use the pretraining-finetuning paradigm as our training framework to effectively transfer prior pattern knowledge across pretraining and finetuning datasets with different periodicity distributions. Our method introduces both frequency and time cells as experts after attention modules and leverages the MoE routing mechanism to construct multidimensional sparse representations of input signals. In experiments on six public benchmarks, MoFE-Time has achieved new state-of-the-art performance, reducing MSE and MAE by 6.95% and 6.02% compared to the representative methods Time-MoE. Beyond the existing evaluation benchmarks, we have developed a proprietary dataset, NEV-sales, derived from real-world business scenarios. Our method achieves outstanding results on this dataset, underscoring the effectiveness of the MoFE-Time model in practical commercial applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quadratic Gating Mixture of Experts: Statistical Insights into Self-Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11222v3)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixture of Experts (MoE) models are well known for effectively scaling model capacity while preserving computational overheads. In this paper, we establish a rigorous relation between MoE and the self-attention mechanism, showing that each row of a self-attention matrix can be written as a quadratic gating mixture of linear experts. Motivated by this connection, we conduct a comprehensive convergence analysis of MoE models with two different quadratic gating functions, namely the quadratic polynomial gate and the quadratic monomial gate, offering useful insights into the design of gating and experts for the MoE framework. First, our analysis indicates that the use of the quadratic monomial gate yields an improved sample efficiency for estimating parameters and experts compared to the quadratic polynomial gate. Second, parameter and expert estimation rates become significantly faster when employing non-linear experts in place of linear experts. Combining these theoretical insights with the above link between MoE and self-attention, we propose a novel \emph{active-attention} mechanism where we apply a non-linear activation function to the value matrix in the formula of self-attention. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed active-attention outperforms the standard self-attention through several extensive experiments in various tasks, including image classification, language modeling, and multivariate time series forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pedra...</summary><p>Pedram Akbarian, Huy Nguyen, and Xing Han made equal contributions to this work</p></details> |
| **[Forecasting the U.S. Renewable-Energy Mix with an ALR-BDARMA Compositional Time-Series Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04087v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate forecasts of the US renewable-generation mix are critical for planning transmission upgrades, sizing storage, and setting balancing-market rules. We present a Bayesian Dirichlet ARMA (BDARMA) model for monthly shares of hydro, geothermal, solar, wind, wood, municipal waste, and biofuels from January 2010 to January 2025. The mean vector follows a parsimonious VAR(2) in additive-log-ratio space, while the Dirichlet concentration parameter combines an intercept with ten Fourier harmonics, letting predictive dispersion expand or contract with the seasons. A 61-split rolling-origin study generates twelve-month density forecasts from January 2019 to January 2024. Relative to three benchmarks, a Gaussian VAR(2) in transform space, a seasonal naive copy of last year's proportions, and a drift-free additive-log-ratio random walk, BDARMA lowers the mean continuous ranked probability score by fifteen to sixty percent, achieves component-wise ninety percent interval coverage close to nominal, and matches Gaussian VAR point accuracy through eight months with a maximum loss of 0.02 Aitchison units thereafter. BDARMA therefore delivers sharp, well-calibrated probabilistic forecasts of multivariate renewable-energy shares without sacrificing point precision.</p></details> |  |
| **[AI-Based Demand Forecasting and Load Balancing for Optimising Energy use in Healthcare Systems: A real case study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06077v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper tackles the urgent need for efficient energy management in healthcare facilities, where fluctuating demands challenge operational efficiency and sustainability. Traditional methods often prove inadequate, causing inefficiencies and higher costs. To address this, the study presents an AI-based framework combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), genetic algorithm (GA), and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations), specifically designed for healthcare energy management. Although LSTM is widely used for time-series forecasting, its application in healthcare energy prediction remains underexplored. The results reveal that LSTM significantly outperforms ARIMA and Prophet models in forecasting complex, non-linear demand patterns. LSTM achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 21.69 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 29.96, far better than Prophet (MAE: 59.78, RMSE: 81.22) and ARIMA (MAE: 87.73, RMSE: 125.22), demonstrating superior performance. The genetic algorithm is applied to optimize model parameters and improve load balancing strategies, enabling adaptive responses to real-time energy fluctuations. SHAP analysis further enhances model transparency by explaining the influence of different features on predictions, fostering trust in decision-making processes. This integrated LSTM-GA-SHAP approach offers a robust solution for improving forecasting accuracy, boosting energy efficiency, and advancing sustainability in healthcare facilities. Future research may explore real-time deployment and hybridization with reinforcement learning for continuous optimization.

It is implemented as a Python toolkit, with source code and documentation available from https://must-deep-learning.github.io/KnowIt. It imposes minimal assumptions about task specifications and decouples the definition of dataset, deep neural network architecture, and interpretability technique through well defined interfaces.

| **[DRAN: A Distribution and Relation Adaptive Network for Spatio-temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01531v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate predictions of spatio-temporal systems are crucial for tasks such as system management, control, and crisis prevention. However, the inherent time variance of many spatio-temporal systems poses challenges to achieving accurate predictions whenever stationarity is not granted. In order to address non-stationarity, we propose a Distribution and Relation Adaptive Network (DRAN) capable of dynamically adapting to relation and distribution changes over time. While temporal normalization and de-normalization are frequently used techniques to adapt to distribution shifts, this operation is not suitable for the spatio-temporal context as temporal normalization scales the time series of nodes and possibly disrupts the spatial relations among nodes. In order to address this problem, a Spatial Factor Learner (SFL) module is developed that enables the normalization and de-normalization process. To adapt to dynamic changes in spatial relationships among sensors, we propose a Dynamic-Static Fusion Learner (DSFL) module that effectively integrates features learned from both dynamic and static relations through an adaptive fusion ratio mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce a Stochastic Learner to capture the noisy components of spatio-temporal representations. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on weather prediction and traffic flow forecasting tasks.Experimental results show that our SFL efficiently preserves spatial relationships across various temporal normalization operations. Visualizations of the learned dynamic and static relations demonstrate that DSFL can capture both local and distant relationships between nodes.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |

The study of such properties on dependent data is still a challenge. In this paper, we carry out deep learning from strongly mixing observations, and deal with the squared and a broad class of loss functions. We consider sparse-penalized regularization for deep neural network predictor. For a general framework that includes, regression estimation, classification, time series prediction,$\cdots$, oracle inequality for the expected excess risk is established and a bound on the class of H\"older smooth functions is provided. For nonparametric regression from strong mixing data and sub-exponentially error, we provide an oracle inequality for the $L_2$ error and investigate an upper bound of this error on a class of H\"older composition functions. For the specific case of nonparametric autoregression with Gaussian and Laplace errors, a lower bound of the $L_2$ error on this H\"older composition class is established. Up to logarithmic factor, this bound matches its upper bound; so, the deep neural network estimator attains the minimax optimal rate.</p></details> |  |

Time series forecasting remains a challenging task, demanding effective sequence representation, meaningful information extraction, and precise future projection. Each dataset and forecasting configuration constitutes a distinct task, each posing unique challenges the model must overcome to produce accurate predictions. To systematically address these task-specific difficulties, this work decomposes the time series forecasting pipeline into three core stages: input sequence representation, information extraction and memory construction, and final target projection. Within each stage, we investigate a range of architectural configurations to assess the effectiveness of various modules, such as convolutional layers for feature extraction and self-attention mechanisms for information extraction, across diverse forecasting tasks, including evaluations on seven benchmark datasets. Our models achieve state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy while greatly enhancing computational efficiency, with reduced training and inference times and a lower parameter count.

| **[Predicting Graph Structure via Adapted Flux Balance Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05806v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many dynamic processes such as telecommunication and transport networks can be described through discrete time series of graphs. Modelling the dynamics of such time series enables prediction of graph structure at future time steps, which can be used in applications such as detection of anomalies. Existing approaches for graph prediction have limitations such as assuming that the vertices do not to change between consecutive graphs. To address this, we propose to exploit time series prediction methods in combination with an adapted form of flux balance analysis (FBA), a linear programming method originating from biochemistry. FBA is adapted to incorporate various constraints applicable to the scenario of growing graphs. Empirical evaluations on synthetic datasets (constructed via Preferential Attachment model) and real datasets (UCI Message, HePH, Facebook, Bitcoin) demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>exten...</summary><p>extended and revised version of arXiv:2401.04280</p></details> |

Most TSAD methods driven by forecasting models tend to overfit by emphasizing minor fluctuations. Our analysis reveals that effective TSAD should focus on modeling "normal" behavior through smooth local patterns. To achieve this, we reformulate time series modeling as approximating the series with smooth univariate functions. The local smoothness of each univariate function ensures that the fitted time series remains resilient against local disturbances. However, a direct KAN implementation proves susceptible to these disturbances due to the inherently localized characteristics of B-spline functions. We thus propose KAN-AD, replacing B-splines with truncated Fourier expansions and introducing a novel lightweight learning mechanism that emphasizes global patterns while staying robust to local disturbances. On four popular TSAD benchmarks, KAN-AD achieves an average 15% improvement in detection accuracy (with peaks exceeding 27%) over state-of-the-art baselines. Remarkably, it requires fewer than 1,000 trainable parameters, resulting in a 50% faster inference speed compared to the original KAN, demonstrating the approach's efficiency and practical viability.</p></details> | 11 pages, ICML 2025 |

This paper addresses the critical challenges of anomaly detection, root cause localization, and anomaly type classification in dynamical systems governed by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We define two categories of anomalies: cyber anomalies, which propagate through interconnected variables, and measurement anomalies, which remain localized to individual variables. To address these challenges, we propose the Interpretable Causality Ordinary Differential Equation (ICODE) Networks, a model-intrinsic explainable learning framework. ICODE leverages Neural ODEs for anomaly detection while employing causality inference through an explanation channel to perform root cause analysis (RCA), elucidating why specific time periods are flagged as anomalous. ICODE is designed to simultaneously perform anomaly detection, RCA, and anomaly type classification within a single, interpretable framework. Our approach is grounded in the hypothesis that anomalies alter the underlying ODEs of the system, manifesting as changes in causal relationships between variables. We provide a theoretical analysis of how perturbations in learned model parameters can be utilized to identify anomalies and their root causes in time series data. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of ICODE across various dynamical systems, showcasing its ability to accurately detect anomalies, classify their types, and pinpoint their origins.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the AAAI-25 Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Cyber Security (AICS)</p></details> |

Two types of techniques are commonly used to reduce the number of parameters - regularization and dimension reduction. In this project, we combine them by imposing a sparse factor structure and propose a regularized estimator to further reduce the number of parameters in factor models. A challenge limiting the widespread application of factor models is that factors are hard to interpret, as both factors and the loading matrix are unobserved. To address this, we introduce a penalty term when estimating the loading matrix for a sparse estimate. As a result, each factor only drives a smaller subset of time series that exhibit the strongest correlation, improving the factor interpretability. The theoretical properties of the proposed estimator are investigated. The simulation results are presented to confirm that our algorithm performs well. We apply our method to Hawaii tourism data.</p></details> |  |

TCP integrates quantile regression with a conformal calibration layer that adapts online via a decaying learning rate. This hybrid design bridges statistical and machine learning paradigms, enabling TCP to accommodate non-stationarity, volatility clustering, and regime shifts which are hallmarks of real-world asset returns, without relying on rigid parametric assumptions. We benchmark TCP against established methods including GARCH, Historical Simulation, and static Quantile Regression across equities (S&P 500), cryptocurrency (Bitcoin), and commodities (Gold). Empirical results show that TCP consistently delivers sharper intervals with competitive or superior coverage, particularly in high-volatility regimes. Our study underscores TCP's strength in navigating the coverage-sharpness tradeoff, a central challenge in modern risk forecasting. Overall, TCP offers a distribution-free, adaptive, and interpretable alternative for financial uncertainty quantification, advancing the interface between statistical inference and machine learning in finance.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Bayesian workflow for securitizing casualty insurance risk](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14666v3)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Casualty insurance-linked securities (ILS) are appealing to investors because the underlying insurance claims, which are directly related to resulting security performance, are uncorrelated with most other asset classes. Conversely, casualty ILS are appealing to insurers as an efficient capital management tool. However, securitizing casualty insurance risk is non-trivial, as it requires forecasting loss ratios for pools of insurance policies that have not yet been written, in addition to estimating how the underlying losses will develop over time within future accident years. In this paper, we lay out a Bayesian workflow that tackles these complexities by using: (1) theoretically informed time-series and state-space models to capture how loss ratios develop and change over time; (2) historic industry data to inform prior distributions of models fit to individual programs; (3) stacking to combine loss ratio predictions from candidate models, and (4) both prior predictive simulations and simulation-based calibration to aid model specification. Using historic Schedule P filings, we then show how our proposed Bayesian workflow can be used to assess and compare models across a variety of key model performance metrics evaluated on future accident year losses.</p></details> | 41 pages, 12 figures |

This entanglement limits model generalization, especially in heterogeneous or multi-instrument settings. We present a causally-motivated foundation model that explicitly disentangles physical and instrumental factors using a dual-encoder architecture trained with structured contrastive learning. Leveraging naturally occurring observational triplets (i.e., where the same target is measured under varying conditions, and distinct targets are measured under shared conditions) our model learns separate latent representations for the underlying physical signal and instrument effects. Evaluated on simulated astronomical time series designed to resemble the complexity of variable stars observed by missions like NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), our method significantly outperforms traditional single-latent space foundation models on downstream prediction tasks, particularly in low-data regimes. These results demonstrate that our model supports key capabilities of foundation models, including few-shot generalization and efficient adaptation, and highlight the importance of encoding causal structure into representation learning for structured data.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

In this work, we draw inspiration from adaptive and structured dynamics observed in biological neural systems and introduce the Adaptive Unitary State Space Model (AUSSM)- a novel class of SSMs that leverages skew-symmetric, input-dependent recurrence to achieve unitary evolution and high expressive power. Using algebraic automata theory, we prove that AUSSM can perform modulo counting and simulate solvable group automata at finite precision, enabling SSMs to model a broad class of regular languages that are out of reach for other SSM architectures. To overcome the practical inefficiencies of adaptive recurrence, we develop a separable convolution formulation and a CUDA implementation that enables scalable parallel training. Empirically, we show that AUSSM when interleaved with Mamba outperform prior SSMs on formal algorithmic tasks such as parity and modular arithmetic, and achieve competent performance on real-world long time-series classification benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that adaptive unitary recurrence provides a powerful and efficient inductive bias for both symbolic and continuous sequence modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Local Representation Alignment RNNs Solve Temporal Tasks?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13531v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are commonly used for real-time processing, streaming data, and cases where the amount of training samples is limited. Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) is the predominant algorithm for training RNNs; however, it is frequently criticized for being prone to exploding and vanishing gradients and being biologically implausible. In this paper, we present and evaluate a target propagation-based method for RNNs, which uses local updates and seeks to reduce the said instabilities. Having stable RNN models increases their practical use in a wide range of fields such as natural language processing, time-series forecasting, anomaly detection, control systems, and robotics. The proposed solution uses local representation alignment (LRA). We thoroughly analyze the performance of this method, experiment with normalization and different local error functions, and invalidate certain assumptions about the behavior of this type of learning. Namely, we demonstrate that despite the decomposition of the network into sub-graphs, the model still suffers from vanishing gradients. We also show that gradient clipping as proposed in LRA has little to no effect on network performance. This results in an LRA RNN model that is very difficult to train due to vanishing gradients. We address this by introducing gradient regularization in the direction of the update and demonstrate that this modification promotes gradient flow and meaningfully impacts convergence. We compare and discuss the performance of the algorithm, and we show that the regularized LRA RNN considerably outperforms the unregularized version on three landmark tasks: temporal order, 3-bit temporal order, and random permutation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the version of the paper presented at ICCSM 2025 (July 2025 in Rome, Italy).

In the model we study, at each time point \( t = 1,2,\ldots \), we observe a deformed Wigner matrix \( \mathbf{M}_t \), where the unobservable deformation represents a latent signal. This signal is detectable only in the supercritical regime, and our objective is to detect the transition to this regime in real time, as new matrix--valued observations arrive. Our approach is based on a partial sum process of extremal eigenvalues of $\mathbf{M}_t$, and its theoretical analysis combines state-of-the-art tools from random-matrix-theory and Gaussian approximations. The resulting detector is self-normalized, which ensures appropriate scaling for convergence and a pivotal limit, without any additional parameter estimation. Simulations show excellent performance for varying dimensions. Applications to pollution monitoring and social interactions in primates illustrate the usefulness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Solar Flare Prediction Using LSTM and DLSTM with Sliding Window Pattern Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05313v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Decomposition-LSTM (DLSTM) networks, combined with an ensemble algorithm, to predict solar flare occurrences using time-series data from the GOES catalog. The dataset spans from 2003 to 2023 and includes 151,071 flare events. Among approximately possible patterns, 7,552 yearly pattern windows are identified, highlighting the challenge of long-term forecasting due to the Sun's complex, self-organized criticality-driven behavior. A sliding window technique is employed to detect temporal quasi-patterns in both irregular and regularized flare time series. Regularization reduces complexity, enhances large flare activity, and captures active days more effectively. To address class imbalance, resampling methods are applied. LSTM and DLSTM models are trained on sequences of peak fluxes and waiting times from irregular time series, while LSTM and DLSTM, integrated with an ensemble approach, are applied to sliding windows of regularized time series with a 3-hour interval. Performance metrics, particularly TSS (0.74), recall (0.95) and the area under the curve (AUC=0.87) in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC), indicate that DLSTM with an ensemble approach on regularized time series outperforms other models, offering more accurate large-flare forecasts with fewer false errors compared to models trained on irregular time series. The superior performance of DLSTM is attributed to its ability to decompose time series into trend and seasonal components, effectively isolating random noise. This study underscores the potential of advanced machine learning techniques for solar flare prediction and highlights the importance of incorporating various solar cycle phases and resampling strategies to enhance forecasting reliability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series, volume 279, 2025, DOI: 10.3847/1538-4365/addc73</p></details> |

While Deep Learning (DL) methods have demonstrated strong forecasting capabilities, their adoption in industrial CPS remains limited due insufficient robustness. Existing robustness evaluations primarily focus on formal verification or adversarial perturbations, inadequately representing the complexities encountered in real-world CPS scenarios. To address this, we introduce a practical robustness definition grounded in distributional robustness, explicitly tailored to industrial CPS, and propose a systematic framework for robustness evaluation. Our framework simulates realistic disturbances, such as sensor drift, noise and irregular sampling, enabling thorough robustness analyses of forecasting models on real-world CPS datasets. The robustness definition provides a standardized score to quantify and compare model performance across diverse datasets, assisting in informed model selection and architecture design. Through extensive empirical studies evaluating prominent DL architectures (including recurrent, convolutional, attention-based, modular, and structured state-space models) we demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of our approach. We publicly release our robustness benchmark to encourage further research and reproducibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 30th IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA)</p></details> |

The Lyapunov exponent is a key measure of chaotic behavior, but its accurate estimation from experimental data is often hindered by methodological and computational limitations. In this work, we present a novel machine-learning-based approach for estimating the positive Lyapunov exponent (MLE) from one-dimensional time series, using the growth of out-of-sample prediction errors as a proxy for trajectory divergence. Our method demonstrates high scientific relevance, offering a robust, data-driven alternative to traditional analytic techniques. Through comprehensive testing on several canonical chaotic maps - including the logistic, sine, cubic, and Chebyshev maps - we achieved a coefficient of determination R2pos > 0.9 between predicted and theoretical MLE values for time series as short as M = 200 points. The best accuracy was observed for the Chebyshev map (R2pos = 0.999). Notably, the proposed method maintains high computational efficiency and generalizes well across various machine learning algorithms. These results highlight the significance of our approach for practical chaos analysis in both synthetic and experimental settings, opening new possibilities for robust nonlinear dynamics assessment when only time series data are available.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 3 figures, 2 Tables, 10 Equations</p></details> |

Recent advancements have demonstrated the potential of multi-scale analysis approaches, which provide an effective solution for capturing these complex temporal patterns. However, existing multi-scale analysis-based time series prediction methods fail to eliminate redundant scale-shared features across multi-scale time series, resulting in the model over- or under-focusing on scale-shared features. To address this issue, we propose a novel end-to-end Disentangled Multi-Scale framework for Time Series classification (DisMS-TS). The core idea of DisMS-TS is to eliminate redundant shared features in multi-scale time series, thereby improving prediction performance. Specifically, we propose a temporal disentanglement module to capture scale-shared and scale-specific temporal representations, respectively. Subsequently, to effectively learn both scale-shared and scale-specific temporal representations, we introduce two regularization terms that ensure the consistency of scale-shared representations and the disparity of scale-specific representations across all temporal scales. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets validate the superiority of DisMS-TS over its competitive baselines, with the accuracy improvement up to 9.71%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for presentation at the ACM International Conference on Multimedia (ACM MM 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Selective Prediction via Training Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13532v4)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Selective Prediction is the task of rejecting inputs a model would predict incorrectly on. This involves a trade-off between input space coverage (how many data points are accepted) and model utility (how good is the performance on accepted data points). Current methods for selective prediction typically impose constraints on either the model architecture or the optimization objective; this inhibits their usage in practice and introduces unknown interactions with pre-existing loss functions. In contrast to prior work, we show that state-of-the-art selective prediction performance can be attained solely from studying the (discretized) training dynamics of a model. We propose a general framework that, given a test input, monitors metrics capturing the instability of predictions from intermediate models (i.e., checkpoints) obtained during training w.r.t. the final model's prediction. In particular, we reject data points exhibiting too much disagreement with the final prediction at late stages in training. The proposed rejection mechanism is domain-agnostic (i.e., it works for both discrete and real-valued prediction) and can be flexibly combined with existing selective prediction approaches as it does not require any train-time modifications. Our experimental evaluation on image classification, regression, and time series problems shows that our method beats past state-of-the-art accuracy/utility trade-offs on typical selective prediction benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR)</p></details> |

This approach, named Functional Nonlinear AutoRegressive with eXogenous inputs (F-NARX), approximates the system response based on temporal features of the exogenous inputs and the system response. This marks a major step away from the discrete-time-centric approach of classical NARX models, which determines the relationship between selected time steps of the input/output time series. By modeling the system in a time-feature space, F-NARX takes advantage of the temporal smoothness of the process being modeled, providing more stable predictions and reducing the dependence of model performance on the discretization of the time axis. In this work, we introduce an F-NARX implementation based on principal component analysis and polynomial regression. To further improve prediction accuracy, we also introduce a modified hybrid least angle regression approach to identify a sparse model structure and minimize the expected forecast error, rather than the one-step-ahead prediction error. We investigate the behavior and capabilities of our F-NARX implementation on two case studies: an eight-story building under wind loading and a three-story steel frame under seismic loading. Our results demonstrate that F-NARX has several favorable properties that make it well-suited to surrogate modeling applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[DC-Mamber: A Dual Channel Prediction Model based on Mamba and Linear Transformer for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04381v1)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF), existing strategies for processing sequences are typically categorized as channel-independent and channel-mixing. The former treats all temporal information of each variable as a token, focusing on capturing local temporal features of individual variables, while the latter constructs a token from the multivariate information at each time step, emphasizing the modeling of global temporal dependencies. Current mainstream models are mostly based on Transformer and the emerging Mamba. Transformers excel at modeling global dependencies through self-attention mechanisms but exhibit limited sensitivity to local temporal patterns and suffer from quadratic computational complexity, restricting their efficiency in long-sequence processing. In contrast, Mamba, based on state space models (SSMs), achieves linear complexity and efficient long-range modeling but struggles to aggregate global contextual information in parallel. To overcome the limitations of both models, we propose DC-Mamber, a dual-channel forecasting model based on Mamba and linear Transformer for time series forecasting. Specifically, the Mamba-based channel employs a channel-independent strategy to extract intra-variable features, while the Transformer-based channel adopts a channel-mixing strategy to model cross-timestep global dependencies. DC-Mamber first maps the raw input into two distinct feature representations via separate embedding layers. These representations are then processed by a variable encoder (built on Mamba) and a temporal encoder (built on linear Transformer), respectively. Finally, a fusion layer integrates the dual-channel features for prediction. Extensive experiments on eight public datasets confirm DC-Mamber's superior accuracy over existing models.</p></details> |  |

Using the fact that the location parameter $\mu$ in a $\tau$-tilted asymmetric Laplace distribution corresponds to the $\tau^{th}$ quantile, we build a check-loss likelihood targeting $\mu$ as the parameter of interest. We equip the check-loss likelihood parametrized by $\mu=f(X,\tau)$ with a BART prior on $f(\cdot)$, allowing the conditional quantile function to vary both in $X$ and $\tau$. The posterior distribution over $\mu(\tau,X)$ can be then distilled for estimation of the {\em entire quantile function} as well as for assessing uncertainty through the variation of posterior draws. Simulation-based predictive inference is immediately available through inverse transform sampling using the learned quantile function. The sum-of-trees structure over the conditional quantile function enables flexible distribution-free regression with theoretical guarantees. As a byproduct, we investigate posterior mean quantile estimator as an alternative to the routine sample (posterior mode) quantile estimator. We demonstrate the power of IQ-BART on time series forecasting datasets where IQ-BART can capture multimodality in predictive distributions that might be otherwise missed using traditional parametric approaches.</p></details> | 48 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Model selection for stochastic dynamics: a parsimonious and principled approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04121v1)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This thesis focuses on the discovery of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) from noisy and discrete time series. A major challenge is selecting the simplest possible correct model from vast libraries of candidate models, where standard information criteria (AIC, BIC) are often limited. We introduce PASTIS (Parsimonious Stochastic Inference), a new information criterion derived from extreme value theory. Its penalty term, $n_\mathcal{B} \ln(n_0/p)$, explicitly incorporates the size of the initial library of candidate parameters ($n_0$), the number of parameters in the considered model ($n_\mathcal{B}$), and a significance threshold ($p$). This significance threshold represents the probability of selecting a model containing more parameters than necessary when comparing many models. Benchmarks on various systems (Lorenz, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, Lotka-Volterra for SDEs; Gray-Scott for SPDEs) demonstrate that PASTIS outperforms AIC, BIC, cross-validation (CV), and SINDy (a competing method) in terms of exact model identification and predictive capability. Furthermore, real-world data can be subject to large sampling intervals ($\Delta t$) or measurement noise ($\sigma$), which can impair model learning and selection capabilities. To address this, we have developed robust variants of PASTIS, PASTIS-$\Delta t$ and PASTIS-$\sigma$, thus extending the applicability of the approach to imperfect experimental data. PASTIS thus provides a statistically grounded, validated, and practical methodological framework for discovering simple models for processes with stochastic dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>PhD t...</summary><p>PhD thesis, 201 pages, 29 figures.

| **[Time Distributed Deep Learning Models for Purely Exogenous Forecasting: Application to Water Table Depth Prediction using Weather Image Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13284v2)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Groundwater resources are one of the most relevant elements in the water cycle, therefore developing models to accurately predict them is a pivotal task in the sustainable resource management framework. Deep Learning (DL) models have been revealed to be very effective in hydrology, especially by feeding spatially distributed data (e.g. raster data). In many regions, hydrological measurements are difficult to obtain regularly or periodically in time, and in some cases, the last available data are not up to date. Reversely, weather data, which significantly impacts water resources, are usually more available and with higher quality. More specifically, we have proposed two different DL models to predict the water table depth in the Grana-Maira catchment (Piemonte, IT) using only exogenous weather image time series. To deal with the image time series, both models are made of a first Time Distributed Convolutional Neural Network (TDC) which encodes the image available at each time step into a vectorial representation. The first model, TDC-LSTM uses then a Sequential Module based on an LSTM layer to learn temporal relations and output the predictions. The second model, TDC-UnPWaveNet uses instead a new version of the WaveNet architecture, adapted here to output a sequence shorter and completely shifted in the future with respect to the input one. To this aim, and to deal with the different sequence lengths in the UnPWaveNet, we have designed a new Channel Distributed layer, that acts like a Time Distributed one but on the channel dimension, i.e. applying the same set of operations to each channel of the input. TDC-LSTM and TDC-UnPWaveNet have shown both remarkable results. However, the two models have focused on different learnable information: TDC-LSTM has focused more on lowering the bias, while TDC-UnPWaveNet has focused more on the temporal dynamics, maximizing correlation, and KGE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transformer Model for Alzheimer's Disease Progression Prediction Using Longitudinal Visit Sequences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03899v1)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with no known cure that affects tens of millions of people worldwide. Early detection of AD is critical for timely intervention to halt or slow the progression of the disease. In this study, we propose a Transformer model for predicting the stage of AD progression at a subject's next clinical visit using features from a sequence of visits extracted from the subject's visit history. We also rigorously compare our model to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and minimalRNN and assess their performances based on factors such as the length of prior visits and data imbalance. We test the importance of different feature categories and visit history, as well as compare the model to a newer Transformer-based model optimized for time series. Our model demonstrates strong predictive performance despite missing visits and missing features in available visits, particularly in identifying converter subjects -- individuals transitioning to more severe disease stages -- an area that has posed significant challenges in longitudinal prediction. The results highlight the model's potential in enhancing early diagnosis and patient outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference on Health, Inference, and Learning (CHIL, 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Temporal Window Smoothing of Exogenous Variables for Improved Time Series Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05284v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although most transformer-based time series forecasting models primarily depend on endogenous inputs, recent state-of-the-art approaches have significantly improved performance by incorporating external information through exogenous inputs. However, these methods face challenges, such as redundancy when endogenous and exogenous inputs originate from the same source and limited ability to capture long-term dependencies due to fixed look-back windows. In this paper, we propose a method that whitens the exogenous input to reduce redundancy that may persist within the data based on global statistics. Additionally, our approach helps the exogenous input to be more aware of patterns and trends over extended periods. By introducing this refined, globally context-aware exogenous input to the endogenous input without increasing the lookback window length, our approach guides the model towards improved forecasting. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in four benchmark datasets, consistently outperforming 11 baseline models. These results establish our method as a robust and effective alternative for using exogenous inputs in time series forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IJCNN 2025</p></details> |
| **[Scientific Machine Learning of Chaotic Systems Discovers Governing Equations for Neural Populations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03631v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discovering governing equations that describe complex chaotic systems remains a fundamental challenge in physics and neuroscience. Here, we introduce the PEM-UDE method, which combines the prediction-error method with universal differential equations to extract interpretable mathematical expressions from chaotic dynamical systems, even with limited or noisy observations. This approach succeeds where traditional techniques fail by smoothing optimization landscapes and removing the chaotic properties during the fitting process without distorting optimal parameters. We demonstrate its efficacy by recovering hidden states in the Rossler system and reconstructing dynamics from noise-corrupted electrical circuit data, where the correct functional form of the dynamics is recovered even when one of the observed time series is corrupted by noise 5x the magnitude of the true signal. We demonstrate that this method is capable of recovering the correct dynamics, whereas direct symbolic regression methods, such as SINDy, fail to do so with the given amount of data and noise. Importantly, when applied to neural populations, our method derives novel governing equations that respect biological constraints such as network sparsity - a constraint necessary for cortical information processing yet not captured in next-generation neural mass models - while preserving microscale neuronal parameters. These equations predict an emergent relationship between connection density and both oscillation frequency and synchrony in neural circuits. We validate these predictions using three intracranial electrode recording datasets from the medial entorhinal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex. Our work provides a pathway to develop mechanistic, multi-scale brain models that generalize across diverse neural architectures, bridging the gap between single-neuron dynamics and macroscale brain activity.</p></details> | 46 pages, 9 figures |
| **[CHIME: Conditional Hallucination and Integrated Multi-scale Enhancement for Time Series Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03502v2)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The denoising diffusion probabilistic model has become a mainstream generative model, achieving significant success in various computer vision tasks. Recently, there has been initial exploration of applying diffusion models to time series tasks. However, existing studies still face challenges in multi-scale feature alignment and generative capabilities across different entities and long-time scales. In this paper, we propose CHIME, a conditional hallucination and integrated multi-scale enhancement framework for time series diffusion models. By employing multi-scale decomposition and integration, CHIME captures the decomposed features of time series, achieving in-domain distribution alignment between generated and original samples. In addition, we introduce a feature hallucination module in the conditional denoising process, enabling the temporal features transfer across long-time scales. Experimental results on publicly available real-world datasets demonstrate that CHIME achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits excellent generative generalization capabilities in few-shot scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReTimeCausal: EM-Augmented Additive Noise Models for Interpretable Causal Discovery in Irregular Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03310v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies causal discovery in irregularly sampled time series-a pivotal challenge in high-stakes domains like finance, healthcare, and climate science, where missing data and inconsistent sampling frequencies distort causal mechanisms. Traditional methods (e.g., Granger causality, PCMCI) fail to reconcile multi-scale interactions (e.g., hourly storms vs. decadal climate shifts), while neural approaches (e.g., CUTS+) lack interpretability, stemming from a critical gap: existing frameworks either rigidly assume temporal regularity or aggregate dynamics into opaque representations, neglecting real-world granularity and auditable logic. To bridge this gap, we propose ReTimeCausal, a novel integration of Additive Noise Models (ANM) and Expectation-Maximization (EM) that unifies physics-guided data imputation with sparse causal inference. Through kernelized sparse regression and structural constraints, ReTimeCausal iteratively refines missing values (E-step) and causal graphs (M-step), resolving cross-frequency dependencies and missing data issues. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that ReTimeCausal outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods under challenging irregular sampling and missing data conditions.</p></details> | 12 pages, 2 figures |
| **[PiCME: Pipeline for Contrastive Modality Evaluation and Encoding in the MIMIC Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03165v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal deep learning holds promise for improving clinical prediction by integrating diverse patient data, including text, imaging, time-series, and structured demographics. Contrastive learning facilitates this integration by producing a unified representation that can be reused across tasks, reducing the need for separate models or encoders. Although contrastive learning has seen success in vision-language domains, its use in clinical settings remains largely limited to image and text pairs. We propose the Pipeline for Contrastive Modality Evaluation and Encoding (PiCME), which systematically assesses five clinical data types from MIMIC: discharge summaries, radiology reports, chest X-rays, demographics, and time-series. We pre-train contrastive models on all 26 combinations of two to five modalities and evaluate their utility on in-hospital mortality and phenotype prediction. To address performance plateaus with more modalities, we introduce a Modality-Gated LSTM that weights each modality according to its contrastively learned importance. Our results show that contrastive models remain competitive with supervised baselines, particularly in three-modality settings. Performance declines beyond three modalities, which supervised models fail to recover. The Modality-Gated LSTM mitigates this drop, improving AUROC from 73.19% to 76.93% and AUPRC from 51.27% to 62.26% in the five-modality setting. We also compare contrastively learned modality importance scores with attribution scores and evaluate generalization across demographic subgroups, highlighting strengths in interpretability and fairness. PiCME is the first to scale contrastive learning across all modality combinations in MIMIC, offering guidance for modality selection, training strategies, and equitable clinical prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multiple data-driven missing imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03061v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces KZImputer, a novel adaptive imputation method for univariate time series designed for short to medium-sized missed points (gaps) (1-5 points and beyond) with tailored strategies for segments at the start, middle, or end of the series. KZImputer employs a hybrid strategy to handle various missing data scenarios. Its core mechanism differentiates between gaps at the beginning, middle, or end of the series, applying tailored techniques at each position to optimize imputation accuracy. The method leverages linear interpolation and localized statistical measures, adapting to the characteristics of the surrounding data and the gap size. The performance of KZImputer has been systematically evaluated against established imputation techniques, demonstrating its potential to enhance data quality for subsequent time series analysis. This paper describes the KZImputer methodology in detail and discusses its effectiveness in improving the integrity of time series data. Empirical analysis demonstrates that KZImputer achieves particularly strong performance for datasets with high missingness rates (around 50% or more), maintaining stable and competitive results across statistical and signal-reconstruction metrics. The method proves especially effective in high-sparsity regimes, where traditional approaches typically experience accuracy degradation.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/s-kav/kz_data_imputation</p></details> |

| **[Orientation-Aware Sparse Tensor PCA for Efficient Unsupervised Feature Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16985v3)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, introducing Tensor Decomposition (TD) techniques into unsupervised feature selection (UFS) has been an emerging research topic. A tensor structure is beneficial for mining the relations between different modes and helps relieve the computation burden. However, while existing methods exploit TD to preserve the data tensor structure, they do not consider the influence of data orientation and thus have difficulty in handling orientation-specific data such as time series. To solve the above problem, we utilize the orientation-dependent tensor-tensor product from Tensor Singular Value Decomposition based on *M-product (T-SVDM) and extend the one-dimensional Sparse Principal Component Analysis (SPCA) to a tensor form. The proposed sparse tensor PCA model can constrain sparsity at the specified mode and yield sparse tensor principal components, enhancing flexibility and accuracy in learning feature relations. To ensure fast convergence and a flexible description of feature correlation, we develop a convex version specially designed for general UFS tasks and propose an efficient slice-by-slice algorithm that performs dual optimization in the transform domain. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and remarkable computational efficiency of the proposed method for tensor data of diverse structures over the state-of-the-art. When transform axes align with feature distribution patterns, our method is promising for various applications. The codes related to our proposed methods and the experiments are available at https://github.com/zjj20212035/STPCA.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Probabilistic ODE Solvers Without Adaptive Memory Requirements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10530v2)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite substantial progress in recent years, probabilistic solvers with adaptive step sizes can still not solve memory-demanding differential equations -- unless we care only about a single point in time (which is far too restrictive; we want the whole time series). Counterintuitively, the culprit is the adaptivity itself: Its unpredictable memory demands easily exceed our machine's capabilities, making our simulations fail unexpectedly and without warning. Still, dropping adaptivity would abandon years of progress, which can't be the answer. In this work, we solve this conundrum. We develop an adaptive probabilistic solver with fixed memory demands building on recent developments in robust state estimation. Switching to our method (i) eliminates memory issues for long time series, (ii) accelerates simulations by orders of magnitude through unlocking just-in-time compilation, and (iii) makes adaptive probabilistic solvers compatible with scientific computing in JAX.</p></details> |  |
| **[DUST: A Duality-Based Pruning Method For Exact Multiple Change-Point Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02467v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We tackle the challenge of detecting multiple change points in large time series by optimising a penalised likelihood derived from exponential family models. While dynamic programming algorithms can solve this task exactly with at most quadratic time complexity, recent years have seen the development of pruning strategies to improve their time efficiency. However, the two existing approaches have notable limitations: PELT struggles with pruning efficiency in sparse-change scenarios, while FPOP's structure is ill-suited for multi-parametric settings. To address these issues, we introduce the DUal Simple Test (DUST) framework, which prunes candidates by evaluating a dual function against a threshold. This approach is highly flexible and broadly applicable to parametric models of any dimension. Under mild assumptions, we establish strong duality for the underlying non-convex pruning problem. We demonstrate DUST's effectiveness across various change point regimes and models. In particular, for one-parametric models, DUST matches the simplicity of PELT with the efficiency of FPOP. Its use is especially advantageous for non-Gaussian models. Its use is especially advantageous for non-Gaussian models. Finally, we apply DUST to mouse monitoring time series under a change-in-variance model, illustrating its ability to recover the optimal change point structure efficiently.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assembling ensembling: An adventure in approaches across disciplines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02599v2)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When we think of model ensembling or ensemble modeling, there are many possibilities that come to mind in different disciplines. For example, one might think of a set of descriptions of a phenomenon in the world, perhaps a time series or a snapshot of multivariate space, and perhaps that set is comprised of data-independent descriptions, or perhaps it is quite intentionally fit *to* data, or even a suite of data sets with a common theme or intention. The very meaning of 'ensemble' - a collection together - conjures different ideas across and even within disciplines approaching phenomena. In this paper, we present a typology of the scope of these potential perspectives. It is not our goal to present a review of terms and concepts, nor is it to convince all disciplines to adopt a common suite of terms, which we view as futile. Rather, our goal is to disambiguate terms, concepts, and processes associated with 'ensembles' and 'ensembling' in order to facilitate communication, awareness, and possible adoption of tools across disciplines.</p></details> | 34 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Gateformer: Advancing Multivariate Time Series Forecasting through Temporal and Variate-Wise Attention with Gated Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00307v3)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been a recent surge of interest in time series modeling using the Transformer architecture. However, forecasting multivariate time series with Transformer presents a unique challenge as it requires modeling both temporal (cross-time) and variate (cross-variate) dependencies. While Transformer-based models have gained popularity for their flexibility in capturing both sequential and cross-variate relationships, it is unclear how to best integrate these two sources of information in the context of the Transformer architecture while optimizing for both performance and efficiency. We re-purpose the Transformer architecture to effectively model both cross-time and cross-variate dependencies. Our approach begins by embedding each variate independently into a variate-wise representation that captures its cross-time dynamics, and then models cross-variate dependencies through attention mechanisms on these learned embeddings. Gating operations in both cross-time and cross-variate modeling phases regulate information flow, allowing the model to focus on the most relevant features for accurate predictions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across 13 real-world datasets and can be seamlessly integrated into other Transformer-based and LLM-based forecasters, delivering performance improvements up to 20.7\% over original models.

| **[Tensor-product interactions in Markov-switching models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01555v2)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Markov-switching models are a powerful tool for modelling time series data that are driven by underlying latent states. As such, they are widely used in behavioural ecology, where discrete states can serve as proxies for behavioural modes and enable inference on latent behaviour driving e.g. observed movement. To understand drivers of behavioural changes, it is common to link model parameters to covariates. Over the last decade, nonparametric approaches have gained traction in this context to avoid unrealistic parametric assumptions. Nonetheless, existing methods are largely limited to univariate smooth functions of covariates, based on penalised splines, while real processes are typically complex requiring consideration of interaction effects. We address this gap by incorporating tensor-product interactions into Markov-switching models, enabling flexible modelling of multidimensional effects in a computationally efficient manner. Based on the extended Fellner-Schall method, we develop an efficient automatic smoothness selection procedure that is robust and scales well with the number of smooth functions in the model. The method builds on a random effects view of the spline coefficients and yields a recursive penalised likelihood procedure. As special cases, this general framework accommodates bivariate smoothing, function-valued random effects, and space-time interactions. We demonstrate its practical utility through three ecological case studies of an African elephant, common fruitflies, and Arctic muskoxen. The methodology is implemented in the LaMa R package, providing applied ecologists with an accessible and flexible tool for semiparametric inference in hidden-state models. The approach has the potential to drastically improve the level of detail in inference, allowing to fit HMMs with hundreds of parameters, 10-20 (potentially bivariate) smooths to thousands of observations.</p></details> |  |

In clinical environments, discovering the causes driving patient risk evolution is critical for timely intervention, yet existing XAI methods fail to address the unique requirements of clinical time series explanation tasks. To this end, DeltaSHAP addresses three key clinical needs: explaining the changes in the consecutive predictions rather than isolated prediction scores, providing both magnitude and direction of feature attributions, and delivering these insights in real time. By adapting Shapley values to temporal settings, our approach accurately captures feature coalition effects. It further attributes prediction changes using only the actually observed feature combinations, making it efficient and practical for time-sensitive clinical applications. We also introduce new evaluation metrics to evaluate the faithfulness of the attributions for online time series, and demonstrate through experiments on online patient monitoring tasks that DeltaSHAP outperforms state-of-the-art XAI methods in both explanation quality as 62% and computational efficiency as 33% time reduction on the MIMIC-III decompensation benchmark.

Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and T2-weighted cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging can respectively identify scarring and edema areas, both of which are essential for MI risk stratification and prognosis assessment. Although combining complementary information from multi-sequence CMR is useful, acquiring these sequences can be time-consuming and prohibitive, e.g., due to the administration of contrast agents. Cine CMR is a rapid and contrast-free imaging technique that can visualize both motion and structural abnormalities of the myocardium induced by acute MI. Therefore, we present a new end-to-end deep neural network, referred to as CineMyoPS, to segment myocardial pathologies, \ie scars and edema, solely from cine CMR images. Specifically, CineMyoPS extracts both motion and anatomy features associated with MI. Given the interdependence between these features, we design a consistency loss (resembling the co-training strategy) to facilitate their joint learning. Furthermore, we propose a time-series aggregation strategy to integrate MI-related features across the cardiac cycle, thereby enhancing segmentation accuracy for myocardial pathologies. Experimental results on a multi-center dataset demonstrate that CineMyoPS achieves promising performance in myocardial pathology segmentation, motion estimation, and anatomy segmentation.</p></details> |  |

The cities were selected for their diverse economic profiles and hospitality dynamics. Monthly data from 2018 to 2025 were used, with 80% for training and 20% for testing. Advanced time series decomposition and machine learning techniques enabled accurate forecasting and trend identification. Results show that Manchester and Mumbai exhibited the highest predictive accuracy, reflecting stable demand patterns, while Dubai and Bangkok demonstrated higher variability due to seasonal and event-driven influences. The findings validate the effectiveness of LSTM models for urban hospitality forecasting and provide a comparative framework for data-driven decision-making. The models generalisability across global cities highlights its potential utility for tourism stakeholders and urban planners.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating Hypotheses of Dynamic Causal Graphs in Neuroscience: Leveraging Generative Factor Models of Observed Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20697v3)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of hypothesis generation promises to reduce costs in neuroscience by narrowing the range of interventional studies needed to study various phenomena. Existing machine learning methods can generate scientific hypotheses from complex datasets, but many approaches assume causal relationships are static over time, limiting their applicability to systems with dynamic, state-dependent behavior, such as the brain. While some techniques attempt dynamic causal discovery through factor models, they often restrict relationships to linear patterns or impose other simplifying assumptions. We propose a novel method that models dynamic graphs as a conditionally weighted superposition of static graphs, where each static graph can capture nonlinear relationships. This approach enables the detection of complex, time-varying interactions between variables beyond linear limitations. Our method improves f1-scores of predicted dynamic causal patterns by roughly 22-28% on average over baselines in some of our experiments, with some improvements reaching well over 60%. A case study on real brain data demonstrates our method's ability to uncover relationships linked to specific behavioral states, offering valuable insights into neural dynamics.</p></details> |  |

These matrices play a critical role in determining the nonlinear autoregressive representation of an equivariant system. The structural characteristics of these matrices are dictated by the set of symmetries inherent in the system.

| **[Characterizing control between interacting subsystems with deep Jacobian estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01946v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biological function arises through the dynamical interactions of multiple subsystems, including those between brain areas, within gene regulatory networks, and more. A common approach to understanding these systems is to model the dynamics of each subsystem and characterize communication between them. An alternative approach is through the lens of control theory: how the subsystems control one another. This approach involves inferring the directionality, strength, and contextual modulation of control between subsystems. However, methods for understanding subsystem control are typically linear and cannot adequately describe the rich contextual effects enabled by nonlinear complex systems. To bridge this gap, we devise a data-driven nonlinear control-theoretic framework to characterize subsystem interactions via the Jacobian of the dynamics. We address the challenge of learning Jacobians from time-series data by proposing the JacobianODE, a deep learning method that leverages properties of the Jacobian to directly estimate it for arbitrary dynamical systems from data alone. We show that JacobianODEs outperform existing Jacobian estimation methods on challenging systems, including high-dimensional chaos. Applying our approach to a multi-area recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on a working memory selection task, we show that the "sensory" area gains greater control over the "cognitive" area over learning. Furthermore, we leverage the JacobianODE to directly control the trained RNN, enabling precise manipulation of its behavior. Our work lays the foundation for a theoretically grounded and data-driven understanding of interactions among biological subsystems.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Towards Foundation Auto-Encoders for Time-Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01875v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate a novel approach to time-series modeling, inspired by the successes of large pretrained foundation models. We introduce FAE (Foundation Auto-Encoders), a foundation generative-AI model for anomaly detection in time-series data, based on Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs). By foundation, we mean a model pretrained on massive amounts of time-series data which can learn complex temporal patterns useful for accurate modeling, forecasting, and detection of anomalies on previously unseen datasets. FAE leverages VAEs and Dilated Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) to build a generic model for univariate time-series modeling, which could eventually perform properly in out-of-the-box, zero-shot anomaly detection applications. We introduce the main concepts of FAE, and present preliminary results in different multi-dimensional time-series datasets from various domains, including a real dataset from an operational mobile ISP, and the well known KDD 2021 Anomaly Detection dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at ACM KDD 2024, MiLeTS 2024 Workshop, August 25, 2024, Barcelona, Spain</p></details> |
| **[Modeling the Deterioration of Pavement Skid Resistance and Surface Texture After Preventive Maintenance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01842v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the deterioration of skid resistance and surface macrotexture following preventive maintenance using micro-milling techniques. Field data were collected from 31 asphalt pavement sections located across four climatic zones in Texas, encompassing a variety of surface types, milling depths, operational speeds, and drum configurations. A standardized data collection protocol was followed, with measurements taken before milling, immediately after treatment, and at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months post-treatment. Skid number and Mean Profile Depth (MPD) were used to evaluate surface friction and texture characteristics. The dataset was reformatted into a time-series structure with 930 observations, incorporating contextual variables such as climatic zone, treatment parameters, and baseline surface condition. A comparative modeling framework was applied to predict the deterioration trends of both skid resistance and macrotexture over time. Eight regression models, including linear, tree-based, and ensemble methods, were evaluated alongside a sequence-to-one transformer model. Results show that the transformer model achieved the highest prediction accuracy for skid resistance (R2=0.981), while Random Forest performing best for macrotexture prediction (R2 = 0.838). The findings indicate that the degradation of surface characteristics after preventive maintenance is nonlinear and influenced by a combination of environmental and operational factors. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of data-driven modeling in supporting transportation agencies with pavement performance forecasting and maintenance planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-Series JEPA for Predictive Remote Control under Capacity-Limited Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04853v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In remote control systems, transmitting large data volumes (e.g., images, video frames) from wireless sensors to remote controllers is challenging when uplink capacity is limited (e.g., RedCap devices or massive wireless sensor networks). Furthermore, controllers often need only information-rich representations of the original data. To address this, we propose a semantic-driven predictive control combined with a channel-aware scheduling to enhance control performance for multiple devices under limited network capacity. At its core, the proposed framework, coined Time-Series Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (TS-JEPA), encodes high-dimensional sensory data into low-dimensional semantic embeddings at the sensor, reducing communication overhead. Furthermore, TS-JEPA enables predictive inference by predicting future embeddings from current ones and predicted commands, which are directly used by a semantic actor model to compute control commands within the embedding space, eliminating the need to reconstruct raw data. To further enhance reliability and communication efficiency, a channel-aware scheduling is integrated to dynamically prioritize device transmissions based on channel conditions and age of information (AoI). Simulations on inverted cart-pole systems show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms conventional control baselines in communication efficiency, control cost, and predictive accuracy. It enables robust and scalable control under limited network capacity compared to traditional scheduling schemes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simulation and evaluation of local daily temperature and precipitation series derived by stochastic downscaling of ERA5 reanalysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01692v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reanalysis products such as the ERA5 reanalysis are commonly used as proxies for observed atmospheric conditions. These products are convenient to use due to their global coverage, the large number of available atmospheric variables and the physical consistency between these variables, as well as their relatively high spatial and temporal resolutions. However, despite the continuous improvements in accuracy and increasing spatial and temporal resolutions of reanalysis products, they may not always capture local atmospheric conditions, especially for highly localised variables such as precipitation. This paper proposes a computationally efficient stochastic downscaling of ERA5 temperature and precipitation. The method combines information from ERA5 and surface observations from nearby stations in a non-linear regression framework that combines generalised additive models (GAMs) with regression splines and auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) models to produce realistic time series of local daily temperature and precipitation. Using a wide range of evaluation criteria that address different properties of the data, the proposed framework is shown to improve the representation of local temperature and precipitation compared to ERA5 at over 4000 locations in Europe over a period of 60 years.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-collective Calibrating Strategy for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03176v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based approaches have demonstrated significant advancements in time series forecasting. Despite these ongoing developments, the complex dynamics of time series make it challenging to establish the rule of thumb for designing the golden model architecture. In this study, we argue that refining existing advanced models through a universal calibrating strategy can deliver substantial benefits with minimal resource costs, as opposed to elaborating and training a new model from scratch. We first identify a multi-target learning conflict in the calibrating process, which arises when optimizing variables across time steps, leading to the underutilization of the model's learning capabilities. To address this issue, we propose an innovative calibrating strategy called Socket+Plug (SoP). This approach retains an exclusive optimizer and early-stopping monitor for each predicted target within each Plug while keeping the fully trained Socket backbone frozen. The model-agnostic nature of SoP allows it to directly calibrate the performance of any trained deep forecasting models, regardless of their specific architectures. Extensive experiments on various time series benchmarks and a spatio-temporal meteorological ERA5 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of SoP, achieving up to a 22% improvement even when employing a simple MLP as the Plug (highlighted in Figure 1). Code is available at https://github.com/hanyuki23/SoP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[MOMENTI: Scalable Motif Mining in Multidimensional Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14446v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series play a fundamental role in many domains, capturing a plethora of information about the underlying data-generating processes. When a process generates multiple synchronized signals we are faced with multidimensional time series. In this context a fundamental problem is that of motif mining, where we seek patterns repeating twice with minor variations, spanning some of the dimensions. State of the art exact solutions for this problem run in time quadratic in the length of the input time series. We provide a scalable method to find the top-k motifs in multidimensional time series with probabilistic guarantees on the quality of the results. Our algorithm runs in time subquadratic in the length of the input, and returns the exact solution with probability at least $1-\delta$, where $\delta$ is a user-defined parameter. The algorithm is designed to be adaptive to the input distribution, self-tuning its parameters while respecting user-defined limits on the memory to use. Our theoretical analysis is complemented by an extensive experimental evaluation, showing that our algorithm is orders of magnitude faster than the state of the art.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 figures, extended experimental section, change of algorithm name due to a title clash with another paper published in the same issue</p></details> |
| **[Time Series Representations for Classification Lie Hidden in Pretrained Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08641v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series classification is a fundamental task in healthcare and industry, yet the development of time series foundation models (TSFMs) remains limited by the scarcity of publicly available time series datasets. In this work, we propose Time Vision Transformer (TiViT), a framework that converts time series into images to leverage the representational power of frozen Vision Transformers (ViTs) pretrained on large-scale image datasets. First, we theoretically motivate our approach by analyzing the 2D patching of ViTs for time series, showing that it can increase the number of label-relevant tokens and reduce the sample complexity. Second, we empirically demonstrate that TiViT achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard time series classification benchmarks by utilizing the hidden representations of large OpenCLIP models. We explore the structure of TiViT representations and find that intermediate layers with high intrinsic dimension are the most effective for time series classification. Finally, we assess the alignment between TiViT and TSFM representation spaces and identify a strong complementarity, with further performance gains achieved by combining their features. Our findings reveal a new direction for reusing vision representations in a non-visual domain. Code is available at https://github.com/ExplainableML/TiViT.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[A Bayesian framework for change-point detection with uncertainty quantification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01558v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel Bayesian method that can detect multiple structural breaks in the mean and variance of a length $T$ time-series. Our method quantifies the uncertainty by returning $\alpha$-level credible sets around the estimated locations of the breaks. In the case of a single change in the mean and/or the variance of an independent sub-Gaussian sequence, we prove that our method attains a localization rate that is minimax optimal up to a $\log T$ factor. For an $\alpha$-mixing sequence with dependence, we prove this optimality holds up to $\log^2 T$ factor. For $d$-dimensional mean changes, we show that if $d \gtrsim \log T$ and the mean signal is dense, then our method exactly recovers the location of the change at the optimal rate. We show that we can modularly combine single change-point models to detect multiple change-points. This approach enables efficient inference using a variational approximation of the posterior distribution for the change-points. The proposal is applicable to both continuous and count data. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that our method is competitive with the state-of-the-art and returns credible sets that are an order of magnitude smaller than those returned by competitors without sacrificing nominal coverage guarantees. We test our method on real data by detecting i) gating of the ion channels in the outer membrane of a bacterial cell, and ii) changes in the lithological structure of an oil well.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fourier Series Guided Design of Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks for Enhanced Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15377v3)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we apply 1D quantum convolution to address the task of time series forecasting. By encoding multiple points into the quantum circuit to predict subsequent data, each point becomes a feature, transforming the problem into a multidimensional one. Building on theoretical foundations from prior research, which demonstrated that Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) can be expressed as multidimensional Fourier series, we explore the capabilities of different architectures and ansatz. This analysis considers the concepts of circuit expressibility and the presence of barren plateaus. Analyzing the problem within the framework of the Fourier series enabled the design of an architecture that incorporates data reuploading, resulting in enhanced performance. Rather than a strict requirement for the number of free parameters to exceed the degrees of freedom of the Fourier series, our findings suggest that even a limited number of parameters can produce Fourier functions of higher degrees. This highlights the remarkable expressive power of quantum circuits. This observation is also significant in reducing training times. The ansatz with greater expressibility and number of non-zero Fourier coefficients consistently delivers favorable results across different scenarios, with performance metrics improving as the number of qubits increases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fitting Sparse Markov Models to Categorical Time Series Using Convex Clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05485v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Higher-order Markov chains are frequently used to model categorical time series. However, a major problem with fitting such models is the exponentially growing number of parameters in the model order. A popular approach to parsimonious modeling is to use a Variable Length Markov Chain (VLMC), which determines relevant contexts (recent pasts) of variable orders and forms a context tree. A more general parsimonious modeling approach is given by Sparse Markov Models (SMMs), where all possible histories of order $m$ are partitioned such that the transition probability vectors are identical for the histories belonging to any particular group. In this paper, we develop an elegant method of fitting SMMs based on convex clustering and regularization. The regularization parameter is selected using the BIC criterion. Theoretical results establish model selection consistency of our method for large sample size. Extensive simulation results under different set-ups are presented to study finite sample performance of the method. Real data analysis on modelling and classifying disease sub-types demonstrates the applicability of our method as well.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tunnelling Through Time Series: A Probabilistic Visibility Graph for Local and Global Pattern Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01247v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing availability of high-resolution, long-term time series data has highlighted the need for methods capable of capturing both local and global patterns. To address this, we introduce the Probabilistic Visibility Graph (PVG), a novel approach inspired by the quantum tunnelling phenomenon. The PVG extends the classical Visibility Graph (VG) by introducing probabilistic connections between time points that are obstructed in the VG due to intermediate values. We demonstrate the PVG's effectiveness in capturing long-range dependencies through simulations of amplitude-modulated signals and analysis of electrocorticography (ECoG) data under rest and anesthesia conditions. Key results show that the PVG presents distinct network properties between rest and anesthesia, with rest exhibiting stronger small-worldness and scale-free behavior, reflecting a hub-dominated, centralized connectivity structure, compared to anesthesia. These findings highlight the PVG's potential for analyzing complex signals with interacting temporal scales, offering new insights into neural dynamics and other real-world phenomena.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uniform Validity of the Subset Anderson-Rubin Test under Heteroskedasticity and Nonlinearity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01167v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the Anderson-Rubin (AR) statistic for a general set of nonlinear moment restrictions. The statistic is based on the criterion function of the continuous updating estimator (CUE) for a subset of parameters not constrained under the Null. We treat the data distribution nonparametrically with parametric moment restrictions imposed under the Null. We show that subset tests and confidence intervals based on the AR statistic are uniformly valid over a wide range of distributions that include moment restrictions with general forms of heteroskedasticity. We show that the AR based tests have correct asymptotic size when parameters are unidentified, partially identified, weakly or strongly identified. We obtain these results by constructing an upper bound that is using a novel perturbation and regularization approach applied to the first order conditions of the CUE. Our theory applies to both cross-sections and time series data and does not assume stationarity in time series settings or homogeneity in cross-sectional settings.</p></details> |  |
