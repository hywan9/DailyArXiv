| **[A Kernel-Based Approach for Accurate Steady-State Detection in Performance Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04204v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the challenge of accurately detecting the transition from the warmup phase to the steady state in performance metric time series, which is a critical step for effective benchmarking. The goal is to introduce a method that avoids premature or delayed detection, which can lead to inaccurate or inefficient performance analysis. The proposed approach adapts techniques from the chemical reactors domain, detecting steady states online through the combination of kernel-based step detection and statistical methods. By using a window-based approach, it provides detailed information and improves the accuracy of identifying phase transitions, even in noisy or irregular time series. Results show that the new approach reduces total error by 14.5% compared to the state-of-the-art method. It offers more reliable detection of the steady-state onset, delivering greater precision for benchmarking tasks. For users, the new approach enhances the accuracy and stability of performance benchmarking, efficiently handling diverse time series data. Its robustness and adaptability make it a valuable tool for real-world performance evaluation, ensuring consistent and reproducible results.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is under review by Future Generation Computer Systems</p></details> |
| **[CatNet: Controlling the False Discovery Rate in LSTM with SHAP Feature Importance and Gaussian Mirrors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16666v3)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce CatNet, an algorithm that effectively controls False Discovery Rate (FDR) and selects significant features in LSTM. CatNet employs the derivative of SHAP values to quantify the feature importance, and constructs a vector-formed mirror statistic for FDR control with the Gaussian Mirror algorithm. To avoid instability due to nonlinear or temporal correlations among features, we also propose a new kernel-based independence measure. CatNet performs robustly on different model settings with both simulated and real-world data, which reduces overfitting and improves interpretability of the model. Our framework that introduces SHAP for feature importance in FDR control algorithms and improves Gaussian Mirror can be naturally extended to other time-series or sequential deep learning models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Galileo: Learning Global & Local Features of Many Remote Sensing Modalities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09356v3)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a highly multimodal transformer to represent many remote sensing modalities - multispectral optical, synthetic aperture radar, elevation, weather, pseudo-labels, and more - across space and time. These inputs are useful for diverse remote sensing tasks, such as crop mapping and flood detection. However, learning shared representations of remote sensing data is challenging, given the diversity of relevant data modalities, and because objects of interest vary massively in scale, from small boats (1-2 pixels and fast) to glaciers (thousands of pixels and slow). We present a novel self-supervised learning algorithm that extracts multi-scale features across a flexible set of input modalities through masked modeling. Our dual global and local contrastive losses differ in their targets (deep representations vs. shallow input projections) and masking strategies (structured vs. not). Our Galileo is a single generalist model that outperforms SoTA specialist models for satellite images and pixel time series across eleven benchmarks and multiple tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causality-Aware Contrastive Learning for Robust Multivariate Time-Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03964v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Utilizing the complex inter-variable causal relationships within multivariate time-series provides a promising avenue toward more robust and reliable multivariate time-series anomaly detection (MTSAD) but remains an underexplored area of research. This paper proposes Causality-Aware contrastive learning for RObust multivariate Time-Series (CAROTS), a novel MTSAD pipeline that incorporates the notion of causality into contrastive learning. CAROTS employs two data augmentors to obtain causality-preserving and -disturbing samples that serve as a wide range of normal variations and synthetic anomalies, respectively. With causality-preserving and -disturbing samples as positives and negatives, CAROTS performs contrastive learning to train an encoder whose latent space separates normal and abnormal samples based on causality. Moreover, CAROTS introduces a similarity-filtered one-class contrastive loss that encourages the contrastive learning process to gradually incorporate more semantically diverse samples with common causal relationships. Extensive experiments on five real-world and two synthetic datasets validate that the integration of causal relationships endows CAROTS with improved MTSAD capabilities. The code is available at https://github.com/kimanki/CAROTS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Semi-Supervised Model-Free Bayesian State Estimation from Compressed Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07368v6)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider data-driven Bayesian state estimation from compressed measurements (BSCM) of a model-free process. The dimension of the temporal measurement vector is lower than that of the temporal state vector to be estimated, leading to an under-determined inverse problem. The underlying dynamical model of the state's evolution is unknown for a 'model-free process.' Hence, it is difficult to use traditional model-driven methods, for example, Kalman and particle filters. Instead, we consider data-driven methods. We experimentally show that two existing unsupervised learning-based data-driven methods fail to address the BSCM problem in a model-free process. The methods are -- data-driven nonlinear state estimation (DANSE) and deep Markov model (DMM). While DANSE provides good predictive/forecasting performance to model the temporal measurement data as a time series, its unsupervised learning lacks suitable regularization for tackling the BSCM task. We then propose a semi-supervised learning approach and develop a semi-supervised learning-based DANSE method, referred to as SemiDANSE. In SemiDANSE, we use a large amount of unlabelled data along with a limited amount of labelled data, i.e., pairwise measurement-and-state data, which provides the desired regularization. Using three benchmark dynamical systems, we empirically show that the data-driven SemiDANSE provides competitive state estimation performance for BSCM using a handful of different measurement systems, against a hybrid method called KalmanNet and two model-driven methods (extended Kalman filter and unscented Kalman filter) that know the dynamical models exactly.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 12 figures, under review in IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing</p></details> |
| **[Causal Explanations Over Time: Articulated Reasoning for Interactive Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03915v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Structural Causal Explanations (SCEs) can be used to automatically generate explanations in natural language to questions about given data that are grounded in a (possibly learned) causal model. Unfortunately they work for small data only. In turn they are not attractive to offer reasons for events, e.g., tracking causal changes over multiple time steps, or a behavioral component that involves feedback loops through actions of an agent. To this end, we generalize SCEs to a (recursive) formulation of explanation trees to capture the temporal interactions between reasons. We show the benefits of this more general SCE algorithm on synthetic time-series data and a 2D grid game, and further compare it to the base SCE and other existing methods for causal explanations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main paper: 9 pages, References: 2 pages, Supplementary: 9 pages.

| **[Signals as a First-Class Citizen When Querying Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03826v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) tightly integrate computation with physical entities, often generating vast amounts of time series data from thousands of sensors. Although knowledge graphs offer a powerful means to contextualize these data, existing approaches to integrating knowledge graphs with time series data lack a concept to model the continuous temporal values inherent in CPSs. This gap can make expressing computations on the sensor data cumbersome. In this work, we propose the integration of knowledge graphs and signals, a proven concept for modeling temporal values. By treating signals as first-class citizens in query languages, we can enable seamless querying over knowledge graphs and signals. While the knowledge graph captures information on the CPS, signals represent its run-time data from sensors. We discuss the implications of such an approach and propose SigSPARQL, an extension to the SPARQL query language, to demonstrate these concepts. Furthermore, we evaluate the feasibility of implementing SigSPARQL with a prototype and demonstrate the applicability of the query language for a monitoring use case within a CPS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Easy attention: A simple attention mechanism for temporal predictions with transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12874v4)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To improve the robustness of transformer neural networks used for temporal-dynamics prediction of chaotic systems, we propose a novel attention mechanism called easy attention which we demonstrate in time-series reconstruction and prediction. While the standard self attention only makes use of the inner product of queries and keys, it is demonstrated that the keys, queries and softmax are not necessary for obtaining the attention score required to capture long-term dependencies in temporal sequences. Through the singular-value decomposition (SVD) on the softmax attention score, we further observe that self attention compresses the contributions from both queries and keys in the space spanned by the attention score. Therefore, our proposed easy-attention method directly treats the attention scores as learnable parameters. This approach produces excellent results when reconstructing and predicting the temporal dynamics of chaotic systems exhibiting more robustness and less complexity than self attention or the widely-used long short-term memory (LSTM) network. We show the improved performance of the easy-attention method in the Lorenz system, a turbulence shear flow and a model of a nuclear reactor.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages and 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[How PARTs assemble into wholes: Learning the relative composition of images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03682v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The composition of objects and their parts, along with object-object positional relationships, provides a rich source of information for representation learning. Hence, spatial-aware pretext tasks have been actively explored in self-supervised learning. Existing works commonly start from a grid structure, where the goal of the pretext task involves predicting the absolute position index of patches within a fixed grid. However, grid-based approaches fall short of capturing the fluid and continuous nature of real-world object compositions. We introduce PART, a self-supervised learning approach that leverages continuous relative transformations between off-grid patches to overcome these limitations. By modeling how parts relate to each other in a continuous space, PART learns the relative composition of images-an off-grid structural relative positioning process that generalizes beyond occlusions and deformations. In tasks requiring precise spatial understanding such as object detection and time series prediction, PART outperforms strong grid-based methods like MAE and DropPos, while also maintaining competitive performance on global classification tasks with minimal hyperparameter tuning. By breaking free from grid constraints, PART opens up an exciting new trajectory for universal self-supervised pretraining across diverse datatypes-from natural images to EEG signals-with promising potential in video, medical imaging, and audio.</p></details> |  |
| **[CHIME: Conditional Hallucination and Integrated Multi-scale Enhancement for Time Series Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03502v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The denoising diffusion probabilistic model has become a mainstream generative model, achieving significant success in various computer vision tasks. Recently, there has been initial exploration of applying diffusion models to time series tasks. However, existing studies still face challenges in multi-scale feature alignment and generative capabilities across different entities and long-time scales. In this paper, we propose CHIME, a conditional hallucination and integrated multi-scale enhancement framework for time series diffusion models. By employing multi-scale decomposition and adaptive integration, CHIME captures the decomposed features of time series, achieving in-domain distribution alignment between generated and original samples. In addition, we introduce a feature hallucination module in the conditional denoising process, enabling the transfer of temporal features through the training of category-independent transformation layers. Experimental results on publicly available real-world datasets demonstrate that CHIME achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits excellent generative generalization capabilities in few-shot scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[VISTA: Vision-Language Inference for Training-Free Stock Time-Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18570v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stock price prediction remains a complex and high-stakes task in financial analysis, traditionally addressed using statistical models or, more recently, language models. In this work, we introduce VISTA (Vision-Language Inference for Stock Time-series Analysis), a novel, training-free framework that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for multi-modal stock forecasting. VISTA prompts a VLM with both textual representations of historical stock prices and their corresponding line charts to predict future price values. By combining numerical and visual modalities in a zero-shot setting and using carefully designed chain-of-thought prompts, VISTA captures complementary patterns that unimodal approaches often miss. We benchmark VISTA against standard baselines, including ARIMA and text-only LLM-based prompting methods. Experimental results show that VISTA outperforms these baselines by up to 89.83%, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-modal inference for stock time-series analysis and highlighting the potential of VLMs in financial forecasting tasks without requiring task-specific training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Representations and Interventions in Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12915v4)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series foundation models (TSFMs) promise to be powerful tools for a wide range of applications. However, their internal representations and learned concepts are still not well understood. In this study, we investigate the structure and redundancy of representations across various TSFMs, examining the self-similarity of model layers within and across different model sizes. This analysis reveals block-like redundancy in the representations, which can be utilized for informed pruning to improve inference speed and efficiency. Additionally, we explore the concepts learned by these models - such as periodicity and trends - and how these can be manipulated through latent space steering to influence model behavior. Our experiments show that steering interventions can introduce new features, e.g., adding periodicity or trends to signals that initially lacked them. These findings underscore the value of representational analysis for optimizing models and demonstrate how conceptual steering offers new possibilities for more controlled and efficient time series analysis with TSFMs.</p></details> | Accepted at ICML'25 |
| **[Temporal Vegetation Index-Based Unsupervised Crop Stress Detection via Eigenvector-Guided Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03394v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early detection of crop stress is vital for minimizing yield loss and enabling timely intervention in precision agriculture. Traditional approaches using NDRE often detect stress only after visible symptoms appear or require labeled datasets, limiting scalability. This study introduces EigenCL, a novel unsupervised contrastive learning framework guided by temporal NDRE dynamics and biologically grounded eigen decomposition. Using over 10,000 Sentinel-2 NDRE image patches from drought-affected Iowa cornfields, we constructed five-point NDRE time series per patch and derived an RBF similarity matrix. The principal eigenvector explaining 76% of the variance and strongly correlated (r = 0.95) with raw NDRE values was used to define stress-aware similarity for contrastive embedding learning. Unlike existing methods that rely on visual augmentations, EigenCL pulls embeddings together based on biologically similar stress trajectories and pushes apart divergent ones. The learned embeddings formed physiologically meaningful clusters, achieving superior clustering metrics (Silhouette: 0.748, DBI: 0.35) and enabling 76% early stress detection up to 12 days before conventional NDRE thresholds. Downstream classification yielded 95% k-NN and 91% logistic regression accuracy. Validation on an independent 2023 Nebraska dataset confirmed generalizability without retraining. EigenCL offers a label-free, scalable approach for early stress detection that aligns with underlying plant physiology and is suitable for real-world deployment in data-scarce agricultural environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Necessity of Multi-Domain Explanation: An Uncertainty Principle Approach for Deep Time Series Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03267v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A prevailing approach to explain time series models is to generate attribution in time domain. A recent development in time series XAI is the concept of explanation spaces, where any model trained in the time domain can be interpreted with any existing XAI method in alternative domains, such as frequency. The prevailing approach is to present XAI attributions either in the time domain or in the domain where the attribution is most sparse. In this paper, we demonstrate that in certain cases, XAI methods can generate attributions that highlight fundamentally different features in the time and frequency domains that are not direct counterparts of one another. This suggests that both domains' attributions should be presented to achieve a more comprehensive interpretation. Thus it shows the necessity of multi-domain explanation. To quantify when such cases arise, we introduce the uncertainty principle (UP), originally developed in quantum mechanics and later studied in harmonic analysis and signal processing, to the XAI literature. This principle establishes a lower bound on how much a signal can be simultaneously localized in both the time and frequency domains. By leveraging this concept, we assess whether attributions in the time and frequency domains violate this bound, indicating that they emphasize distinct features. In other words, UP provides a sufficient condition that the time and frequency domain explanations do not match and, hence, should be both presented to the end user. We validate the effectiveness of this approach across various deep learning models, XAI methods, and a wide range of classification and forecasting datasets. The frequent occurrence of UP violations across various datasets and XAI methods highlights the limitations of existing approaches that focus solely on time-domain explanations. This underscores the need for multi-domain explanations as a new paradigm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-Shot Time Series Forecasting with Covariates via In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03128v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretrained time series models, capable of zero-shot forecasting, have demonstrated significant potential in enhancing both the performance and accessibility of time series forecasting. However, existing pretrained models either do not support covariates or fail to incorporate them effectively. We introduce COSMIC, a zero-shot forecasting model that utilizes covariates via in-context learning. To address the challenge of data scarcity, we propose Informative Covariate Augmentation, which enables the training of COSMIC without requiring any datasets that include covariates. COSMIC achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot forecasting, both with and without covariates. Our quantitative and qualitative analysis demonstrates that COSMIC effectively leverages covariates in zero-shot forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper was written at the end of 2024</p></details> |

However, the plethora of model formulations, the inconsistent use of terminology, and the various inferential approaches and software packages can be overwhelming to practitioners, especially when they are new to this area. With this review-like paper, we thus aim to provide guidance for both statisticians and practitioners working with latent Markov models by offering a unifying view on what otherwise are often considered separate model classes, from hidden Markov models over state-space models to Markov-modulated Poisson processes. In particular, we provide a roadmap for identifying a suitable latent Markov model formulation given the data to be analysed. Furthermore, we emphasise that it is key to applied work with any of these model classes to understand how recursive techniques exploiting the models' dependence structure can be used for inference. The R package LaMa adapts this unified view and provides an easy-to-use framework for very fast (C++ based) numerical maximum likelihood estimation of any of the models discussed in this paper, allowing users to tailor a latent Markov model to their data using a Lego-type approach.</p></details> | 52 pages, 7 figures |
| **[When Blockchain Meets Crawlers: Real-time Market Analytics in Solana NFT Markets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02892v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we design and implement a web crawler system based on the Solana blockchain for the automated collection and analysis of market data for popular non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the chain. Firstly, the basic information and transaction data of popular NFTs on the Solana chain are collected using the Selenium tool. Secondly, the transaction records of the Magic Eden trading market are thoroughly analyzed by combining them with the Scrapy framework to examine the price fluctuations and market trends of NFTs. In terms of data analysis, this paper employs time series analysis to examine the dynamics of the NFT market and seeks to identify potential price patterns. In addition, the risk and return of different NFTs are evaluated using the mean-variance optimization model, taking into account their characteristics, such as illiquidity and market volatility, to provide investors with data-driven portfolio recommendations. The experimental results show that the combination of crawler technology and financial analytics can effectively analyze NFT data on the Solana blockchain and provide timely market insights and investment strategies. This study provides a reference for further exploration in the field of digital currencies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Binary Cumulative Encoding meets Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24595v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies in time series forecasting have explored formulating regression via classification task. By discretizing the continuous target space into bins and predicting over a fixed set of classes, these approaches benefit from stable training, robust uncertainty modeling, and compatibility with modern deep learning architectures. However, most existing methods rely on one-hot encoding that ignores the inherent ordinal structure of the underlying values. As a result, they fail to provide information about the relative distance between predicted and true values during training. In this paper, we propose to address this limitation by introducing binary cumulative encoding (BCE), that represents scalar targets into monotonic binary vectors. This encoding implicitly preserves order and magnitude information, allowing the model to learn distance-aware representations while still operating within a classification framework. We propose a convolutional neural network architecture specifically designed for BCE, incorporating residual and dilated convolutions to enable fast and expressive temporal modeling. Through extensive experiments on benchmark forecasting datasets, we show that our approach outperforms widely used methods in both point and probabilistic forecasting, while requiring fewer parameters and enabling faster training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Soft Sparse Shapes for Efficient Time-Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06892v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Shapelets are discriminative subsequences (or shapes) with high interpretability in time series classification. Due to the time-intensive nature of shapelet discovery, existing shapelet-based methods mainly focus on selecting discriminative shapes while discarding others to achieve candidate subsequence sparsification. However, this approach may exclude beneficial shapes and overlook the varying contributions of shapelets to classification performance. To this end, we propose a Soft sparse Shapes (SoftShape) model for efficient time series classification. Our approach mainly introduces soft shape sparsification and soft shape learning blocks. The former transforms shapes into soft representations based on classification contribution scores, merging lower-scored ones into a single shape to retain and differentiate all subsequence information. The latter facilitates intra- and inter-shape temporal pattern learning, improving model efficiency by using sparsified soft shapes as inputs. Specifically, we employ a learnable router to activate a subset of class-specific expert networks for intra-shape pattern learning. Meanwhile, a shared expert network learns inter-shape patterns by converting sparsified shapes into sequences. Extensive experiments show that SoftShape outperforms state-of-the-art methods and produces interpretable results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[XicorAttention: Time Series Transformer Using Attention with Nonlinear Correlation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02694v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Various Transformer-based models have been proposed for time series forecasting. These models leverage the self-attention mechanism to capture long-term temporal or variate dependencies in sequences. Existing methods can be divided into two approaches: (1) reducing computational cost of attention by making the calculations sparse, and (2) reshaping the input data to aggregate temporal features. However, existing attention mechanisms may not adequately capture inherent nonlinear dependencies present in time series data, leaving room for improvement. In this study, we propose a novel attention mechanism based on Chatterjee's rank correlation coefficient, which measures nonlinear dependencies between variables. Specifically, we replace the matrix multiplication in standard attention mechanisms with this rank coefficient to measure the query-key relationship. Since computing Chatterjee's correlation coefficient involves sorting and ranking operations, we introduce a differentiable approximation employing SoftSort and SoftRank. Our proposed mechanism, ``XicorAttention,'' integrates it into several state-of-the-art Transformer models. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that incorporating nonlinear correlation into the attention improves forecasting accuracy by up to approximately 9.1\% compared to existing models.</p></details> |  |

However, rapid changes in land surface dynamics necessitate frequent updates, quickly rendering previously collected samples obsolete and imposing significant labor demands for continuous manual updates. In this study, we aim to address this problem by dynamic sample generation using existing single-date static labeled samples. We introduce TasGen, a two-stage automated framework to automatically generate dynamic samples, designed to simultaneously model spectral and temporal dependencies in time-series remote sensing imagery via temporal-spectral embedding, capturing land surface changes without additional manual annotations.</p></details> |  |
| **[SDE: A Simplified and Disentangled Dependency Encoding Framework for State Space Models in Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12068v3)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, advancements in deep learning have spurred the development of numerous models for Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF). However, most existing approaches struggle to fully capture the complex and structured dependencies inherent in time series data. In this work, we identify and formally define three critical dependencies that are fundamental to forecasting accuracy: order dependency and semantic dependency along the temporal dimension, as well as cross-variate dependency across the feature dimension. These dependencies are often treated in isolation, and improper handling can introduce noise and degrade forecasting performance. To bridge this gap, we investigate the potential of State Space Models (SSMs) for LTSF and emphasize their inherent advantages in capturing these essential dependencies. Additionally, we empirically observe that excessive nonlinearity in conventional SSMs introduce redundancy when applied to semantically sparse time series data. Motivated by this insight, we propose SDE (Simplified and Disentangled Dependency Encoding), a novel framework designed to enhance the capability of SSMs for LTSF. Specifically, we first eliminate unnecessary nonlinearities in vanilla SSMs, thereby improving the suitability for time series forecasting. Building on this foundation, we introduce a disentangled encoding strategy, which empowers SSMs to efficiently model cross-variate dependencies while mitigating interference between the temporal and feature dimensions. Furthermore, we provide rigorous theoretical justifications to substantiate our design choices. Extensive experiments on nine real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that SDE-enhanced SSMs consistently outperform state-of-the-art time series forecasting models.Our code is available at https://github.com/YukinoAsuna/SAMBA.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2025 |
| **[Forecasting Company Fundamentals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05791v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Company fundamentals are key to assessing companies' financial and overall success and stability. Forecasting them is important in multiple fields, including investing and econometrics. While statistical and contemporary machine learning methods have been applied to many time series tasks, there is a lack of comparison of these approaches on this particularly challenging data regime. To this end, we try to bridge this gap and thoroughly evaluate the theoretical properties and practical performance of 24 deterministic and probabilistic company fundamentals forecasting models on real company data. We observe that deep learning models provide superior forecasting performance to classical models, in particular when considering uncertainty estimation. To validate the findings, we compare them to human analyst expectations and find that their accuracy is comparable to the automatic forecasts. We further show how these high-quality forecasts can benefit automated stock allocation. We close by presenting possible ways of integrating domain experts to further improve performance and increase reliability.</p></details> | <details><summary>See h...</summary><p>See https://openreview.net/forum?id=haf78jerSt</p></details> |

Despite rigorous examination, labeling errors are inevitable and can significantly impede accurate predictions of patient outcome. To address this challenge, we propose an \textbf{A}ttention-based Learning Framework with Dynamic \textbf{C}alibration and Augmentation for \textbf{T}ime series Noisy \textbf{L}abel \textbf{L}earning (ACTLL). This framework leverages a two-component Beta mixture model to identify the certain and uncertain sets of instances based on the fitness distribution of each class, and it captures global temporal dynamics while dynamically calibrating labels from the uncertain set or augmenting confident instances from the certain set. Experimental results on large-scale EHR datasets eICU and MIMIC-IV-ED, and several benchmark datasets from the UCR and UEA repositories, demonstrate that our model ACTLL has achieved state-of-the-art performance, especially under high noise levels.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discovering Latent Causal Graphs from Spatio-Temporal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05331v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many important phenomena in scientific fields like climate, neuroscience, and epidemiology are naturally represented as spatiotemporal gridded data with complex interactions. Inferring causal relationships from these data is a challenging problem compounded by the high dimensionality of such data and the correlations between spatially proximate points. We present SPACY (SPAtiotemporal Causal discoverY), a novel framework based on variational inference, designed to model latent time series and their causal relationships from spatiotemporal data. SPACY alleviates the high-dimensional challenge by discovering causal structures in the latent space. To aggregate spatially proximate, correlated grid points, we use \change{spatial factors, parametrized by spatial kernel functions}, to map observational time series to latent representations. \change{Theoretically, we generalize the problem to a continuous spatial domain and establish identifiability when the observations arise from a nonlinear, invertible function of the product of latent series and spatial factors. Using this approach, we avoid assumptions that are often unverifiable, including those about instantaneous effects or sufficient variability.} Empirically, SPACY outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on synthetic data, even in challenging settings where existing methods struggle, while remaining scalable for large grids. SPACY also identifies key known phenomena from real-world climate data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Forecasting of Sparse Intraoperative Hypotension Events Powered by Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22116v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) frequently occurs under general anesthesia and is strongly linked to adverse outcomes such as myocardial injury and increased mortality. Despite its significance, IOH prediction is hindered by event sparsity and the challenge of integrating static and dynamic data across diverse patients. In this paper, we propose \textbf{IOHFuseLM}, a multimodal language model framework. To accurately identify and differentiate sparse hypotensive events, we leverage a two-stage training strategy. The first stage involves domain adaptive pretraining on IOH physiological time series augmented through diffusion methods, thereby enhancing the model sensitivity to patterns associated with hypotension. Subsequently, task fine-tuning is performed on the original clinical dataset to further enhance the ability to distinguish normotensive from hypotensive states. To enable multimodal fusion for each patient, we align structured clinical descriptions with the corresponding physiological time series at the token level. Such alignment enables the model to capture individualized temporal patterns alongside their corresponding clinical semantics. In addition, we convert static patient attributes into structured text to enrich personalized information. Experimental evaluations on two intraoperative datasets demonstrate that IOHFuseLM outperforms established baselines in accurately identifying IOH events, highlighting its applicability in clinical decision support scenarios.

| **[Univariate to Multivariate: LLMs as Zero-Shot Predictors for Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02389v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series prediction or forecasting is critical across many real-world dynamic systems, and recent studies have proposed using Large Language Models (LLMs) for this task due to their strong generalization capabilities and ability to perform well without extensive pre-training. However, their effectiveness in handling complex, noisy, and multivariate time-series data remains underexplored. To address this, we propose LLMPred which enhances LLM-based time-series prediction by converting time-series sequences into text and feeding them to LLMs for zero shot prediction along with two main data pre-processing techniques. First, we apply time-series sequence decomposition to facilitate accurate prediction on complex and noisy univariate sequences. Second, we extend this univariate prediction capability to multivariate data using a lightweight prompt-processing strategy. Extensive experiments with smaller LLMs such as Llama 2 7B, Llama 3.2 3B, GPT-4o-mini, and DeepSeek 7B demonstrate that LLMPred achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Additionally, a thorough ablation study highlights the importance of the key components proposed in LLMPred.</p></details> |  |

Paris, France during late the spring and summer months is the major focus. Predictors and responses are drawn from the Paris-Montsouris weather station for the years 2018 through 2024. Q(.95) values are used because of interest in summer heat that is statistically rare and extreme. The data are curated as a multiple time series for each year. Predictors include seven routinely collected indicators of weather conditions. They each are lagged by 14 days such that temperature and heat index forecasts are provided two weeks in advance. Forecasting uncertainty is addressed with conformal prediction regions. Forecasting accuracy is promising. Cairo, Egypt is a second location using data from the weather station at the Cairo Internal Airport over the same years and months. Cairo is a more challenging setting for temperature forecasting because its desert climate can create abrupt and erratic temperature changes. Yet, there is some progress forecasting record-setting hot days.</p></details> | 10 figures |
| **[De-Biasing Structure Function Estimates From Sparse Time Series of the Solar Wind: A Data-Driven Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10053v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Structure functions, which represent the moments of the increments of a stochastic process, are essential complementary statistics to power spectra for analysing the self-similar behaviour of a time series. However, many real-world environmental datasets, such as those collected by spacecraft monitoring the solar wind, contain gaps, which inevitably corrupt the statistics. The nature of this corruption for structure functions remains poorly understood - indeed, often overlooked. Here we simulate gaps in a large set of magnetic field intervals from Parker Solar Probe in order to characterize the behaviour of the structure function of a sparse time series of solar wind turbulence. We quantify the resultant error with regards to the overall shape of the structure function, and its slope in the inertial range. Noting the consistent underestimation of the true curve when using linear interpolation, we demonstrate the ability of an empirical correction factor to de-bias these estimates. This correction, "learnt" from the data from a single spacecraft, is shown to generalize well to data from a solar wind regime elsewhere in the heliosphere, producing smaller errors, on average, for missing fractions >25%. Given this success, we apply the correction to gap-affected Voyager intervals from the inner heliosheath and local interstellar medium, obtaining spectral indices similar to those from previous studies. This work provides a tool for future studies of fragmented solar wind time series, such as those from Voyager, MAVEN, and OMNI, as well as sparsely-sampled astrophysical and geophysical processes more generally.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Performative Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06077v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series forecasting is a critical challenge in various domains and has witnessed substantial progress in recent years. Many real-life scenarios, such as public health, economics, and social applications, involve feedback loops where predictions can influence the predicted outcome, subsequently altering the target variable's distribution. This phenomenon, known as performativity, introduces the potential for 'self-negating' or 'self-fulfilling' predictions. Despite extensive studies in classification problems across domains, performativity remains largely unexplored in the context of time-series forecasting from a machine-learning perspective. In this paper, we formalize performative time-series forecasting (PeTS), addressing the challenge of accurate predictions when performativity-induced distribution shifts are possible. We propose a novel approach, Feature Performative-Shifting (FPS), which leverages the concept of delayed response to anticipate distribution shifts and subsequently predicts targets accordingly. We provide theoretical insights suggesting that FPS can potentially lead to reduced generalization error. We conduct comprehensive experiments using multiple time-series models on COVID-19 and traffic forecasting tasks. The results demonstrate that FPS consistently outperforms conventional time-series forecasting methods, highlighting its efficacy in handling performativity-induced challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages (8 main text, 1 reference, 3 appendix), 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Diffusion Models for Tabular Data Imputation and Synthetic Data Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02549v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data imputation and data generation have important applications for many domains, like healthcare and finance, where incomplete or missing data can hinder accurate analysis and decision-making. Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models capable of capturing complex data distributions across various data modalities such as image, audio, and time series data. Recently, they have been also adapted to generate tabular data. In this paper, we propose a diffusion model for tabular data that introduces three key enhancements: (1) a conditioning attention mechanism, (2) an encoder-decoder transformer as the denoising network, and (3) dynamic masking. The conditioning attention mechanism is designed to improve the model's ability to capture the relationship between the condition and synthetic data. The transformer layers help model interactions within the condition (encoder) or synthetic data (decoder), while dynamic masking enables our model to efficiently handle both missing data imputation and synthetic data generation tasks within a unified framework. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation by comparing the performance of diffusion models with transformer conditioning against state-of-the-art techniques, such as Variational Autoencoders, Generative Adversarial Networks and Diffusion Models, on benchmark datasets. Our evaluation focuses on the assessment of the generated samples with respect to three important criteria, namely: (1) Machine Learning efficiency, (2) statistical similarity, and (3) privacy risk mitigation. For the task of data imputation, we consider the efficiency of the generated samples across different levels of missing features.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

This review synthesizes recent progress in applying autoencoders and vision transformers for unsupervised signal analysis, focusing on their architectures, applications, and emerging trends. We explore how these models enable feature extraction, anomaly detection, and classification across diverse signal types, including electrocardiograms, radar waveforms, and IoT sensor data. The review highlights the strengths of hybrid architectures and self-supervised learning, while identifying challenges in interpretability, scalability, and domain generalization. By bridging methodological innovations and practical applications, this work offers a roadmap for developing robust, adaptive models for signal intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Early Detection of Patient Deterioration from Real-Time Wearable Monitoring System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01305v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early detection of patient deterioration is crucial for reducing mortality rates. Heart rate data has shown promise in assessing patient health, and wearable devices offer a cost-effective solution for real-time monitoring. However, extracting meaningful insights from diverse heart rate data and handling missing values in wearable device data remain key challenges. To address these challenges, we propose TARL, an innovative approach that models the structural relationships of representative subsequences, known as shapelets, in heart rate time series. TARL creates a shapelet-transition knowledge graph to model shapelet dynamics in heart rate time series, indicating illness progression and potential future changes. We further introduce a transition-aware knowledge embedding to reinforce relationships among shapelets and quantify the impact of missing values, enabling the formulation of comprehensive heart rate representations. These representations capture explanatory structures and predict future heart rate trends, aiding early illness detection. We collaborate with physicians and nurses to gather ICU patient heart rate data from wearables and diagnostic metrics assessing illness severity for evaluating deterioration. Experiments on real-world ICU data demonstrate that TARL achieves both high reliability and early detection. A case study further showcases TARL's explainable detection process, highlighting its potential as an AI-driven tool to assist clinicians in recognizing early signs of patient deterioration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-time respiratory motion forecasting with online learning of recurrent neural networks for accurate targeting in externally guided radiotherapy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01607v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In lung radiotherapy, infrared cameras can track reflective objects on the chest to estimate tumor motion due to breathing, but treatment system latencies hinder radiation beam precision. Real-time recurrent learning (RTRL) is a potential solution that can learn patterns within non-stationary respiratory data but has high complexity. This study assesses the capabilities of resource-efficient online RNN algorithms, namely unbiased online recurrent optimization (UORO), sparse-1 step approximation (SnAp-1), and decoupled neural interfaces (DNI) to forecast respiratory motion during radiotherapy treatment accurately. We use time series containing the 3D positions of external markers on the chest of healthy subjects. We propose efficient implementations for SnAp-1 and DNI that compress the influence and immediate Jacobian matrices and accurately update the linear coefficients used in credit assignment estimation, respectively. Data was originally sampled at 10Hz; we resampled it at 3.33Hz and 30Hz to analyze the effect of the sampling rate on performance. We use UORO, SnAp-1, and DNI to forecast each marker's 3D position with horizons h<=2.1s (the time interval in advance for which the prediction is made) and compare them with RTRL, least mean squares, kernel support vector regression, and linear regression. RNNs trained online achieved similar or better accuracy than most previous works using larger training databases and deep learning, even though we used only the first minute of each sequence to predict motion within that exact sequence. SnAp-1 had the lowest normalized root mean square errors (nRMSEs) averaged over the horizon values considered, equal to 0.335 and 0.157, at 3.33Hz and 10.0Hz, respectively. Similarly, UORO had the lowest nRMSE at 30Hz, equal to 0.086. DNI's inference time (6.8ms per time step at 30Hz, Intel Core i7-13700 CPU) was the lowest among the RNN methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 18 figures, accepted manuscript version</p></details> |
| **[Stock Market Telepathy: Graph Neural Networks Predicting the Secret Conversations between MINT and G7 Countries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01945v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emerging economies, particularly the MINT countries (Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria, and T\"urkiye), are gaining influence in global stock markets, although they remain susceptible to the economic conditions of developed countries like the G7 (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States). This interconnectedness and sensitivity of financial markets make understanding these relationships crucial for investors and policymakers to predict stock price movements accurately. To this end, we examined the main stock market indices of G7 and MINT countries from 2012 to 2024, using a recent graph neural network (GNN) algorithm called multivariate time series forecasting with graph neural network (MTGNN). This method allows for considering complex spatio-temporal connections in multivariate time series. In the implementations, MTGNN revealed that the US and Canada are the most influential G7 countries regarding stock indices in the forecasting process, and Indonesia and T\"urkiye are the most influential MINT countries. Additionally, our results showed that MTGNN outperformed traditional methods in forecasting the prices of stock market indices for MINT and G7 countries. Consequently, the study offers valuable insights into economic blocks' markets and presents a compelling empirical approach to analyzing global stock market dynamics using MTGNN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trojan Horse Hunt in Time Series Forecasting for Space Operations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01849v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This competition hosted on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/trojan-horse-hunt-in-space) is the first part of a series of follow-up competitions and hackathons related to the "Assurance for Space Domain AI Applications" project funded by the European Space Agency (https://assurance-ai.space-codev.org/). The competition idea is based on one of the real-life AI security threats identified within the project -- the adversarial poisoning of continuously fine-tuned satellite telemetry forecasting models. The task is to develop methods for finding and reconstructing triggers (trojans) in advanced models for satellite telemetry forecasting used in safety-critical space operations. Participants are provided with 1) a large public dataset of real-life multivariate satellite telemetry (without triggers), 2) a reference model trained on the clean data, 3) a set of poisoned neural hierarchical interpolation (N-HiTS) models for time series forecasting trained on the dataset with injected triggers, and 4) Jupyter notebook with the training pipeline and baseline algorithm (the latter will be published in the last month of the competition). The main task of the competition is to reconstruct a set of 45 triggers (i.e., short multivariate time series segments) injected into the training data of the corresponding set of 45 poisoned models. The exact characteristics (i.e., shape, amplitude, and duration) of these triggers must be identified by participants. The popular Neural Cleanse method is adopted as a baseline, but it is not designed for time series analysis and new approaches are necessary for the task. The impact of the competition is not limited to the space domain, but also to many other safety-critical applications of advanced time series analysis where model poisoning may lead to serious consequences.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ergodic Network Stochastic Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17779v3)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel framework for Network Stochastic Differential Equations (N-SDE), where each node in a network is governed by an SDE influenced by interactions with its neighbors. The evolution of each node is driven by the interplay of three key components: the node's intrinsic dynamics (\emph{momentum effect}), feedback from neighboring nodes (\emph{network effect}), and a \emph{stochastic volatility} term modeled by Brownian motion. Our primary objective is to estimate the parameters of the N-SDE system from high-frequency discrete-time observations. The motivation behind this model lies in its ability to analyze very high-dimensional time series by leveraging the inherent sparsity of the underlying network graph. We consider two distinct scenarios: \textit{i) known network structure}: the graph is fully specified, and we establish conditions under which the parameters can be identified, considering the linear growth of the parameter space with the number of edges. \textit{ii) unknown network structure}: the graph must be inferred from the data. For this, we develop an iterative procedure using adaptive Lasso, tailored to a specific subclass of N-SDE models. In this work, we assume the network graph is oriented, paving the way for novel applications of SDEs in causal inference, enabling the study of cause-effect relationships in dynamic systems. Through extensive simulation studies, we demonstrate the performance of our estimators across various graph topologies in high-dimensional settings. We also showcase the framework's applicability to real-world datasets, highlighting its potential for advancing the analysis of complex networked systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Gaussian Mixture Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01780v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces FedGenGMM, a novel one-shot federated learning approach for Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) tailored for unsupervised learning scenarios. In federated learning (FL), where multiple decentralized clients collaboratively train models without sharing raw data, significant challenges include statistical heterogeneity, high communication costs, and privacy concerns. FedGenGMM addresses these issues by allowing local GMM models, trained independently on client devices, to be aggregated through a single communication round. This approach leverages the generative property of GMMs, enabling the creation of a synthetic dataset on the server side to train a global model efficiently. Evaluation across diverse datasets covering image, tabular, and time series data demonstrates that FedGenGMM consistently achieves performance comparable to non-federated and iterative federated methods, even under significant data heterogeneity. Additionally, FedGenGMM significantly reduces communication overhead, maintains robust performance in anomaly detection tasks, and offers flexibility in local model complexities, making it particularly suitable for edge computing environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 6 figures.

However, the current landscape of DA in TSC is plagued with fragmented literature reviews, nebulous methodological taxonomies, inadequate evaluative measures, and a dearth of accessible and user-oriented tools. This study addresses these challenges through a comprehensive examination of DA methodologies within the TSC domain.Our research began with an extensive literature review spanning a decade, revealing significant gaps in existing surveys and necessitating a detailed analysis of over 100 scholarly articles to identify more than 60 distinct DA techniques. This rigorous review led to the development of a novel taxonomy tailored to the specific needs of DA in TSC, categorizing techniques into five primary categories: Transformation-Based, Pattern-Based, Generative, Decomposition-Based, and Automated Data Augmentation. This taxonomy is intended to guide researchers in selecting appropriate methods with greater clarity. In response to the lack of comprehensive evaluations of foundational DA techniques, we conducted a thorough empirical study, testing nearly 20 DA strategies across 15 diverse datasets representing all types within the UCR time-series repository. Using ResNet and LSTM architectures, we employed a multifaceted evaluation approach, including metrics such as Accuracy, Method Ranking, and Residual Analysis, resulting in a benchmark accuracy of 84.98 +- 16.41% in ResNet and 82.41 +- 18.71% in LSTM. Our investigation underscored the inconsistent efficacies of DA techniques, for instance, methods like RGWs and Random Permutation significantly improved model performance, whereas others, like EMD, were less effective.</p></details> |  |

Such characteristics align closely with the demands of ubiquitous computing systems, which often operate on resource-constrained devices while continuously monitoring and processing time-series sensor data. Despite their unique and promising features, SNNs have received limited attention and remain underexplored (or at least, under-adopted) within the ubiquitous computing community. To address this gap, this paper first introduces the core components of SNNs, both in terms of models and training mechanisms. It then presents a systematic survey of 76 SNN-based studies focused on time-series data analysis, categorizing them into six key application domains. For each domain, we summarize relevant works and subsequent advancements, distill core insights, and highlight key takeaways for researchers and practitioners. To facilitate hands-on experimentation, we also provide a comprehensive review of current software frameworks and neuromorphic hardware platforms, detailing their capabilities and specifications, and then offering tailored recommendations for selecting development tools based on specific application needs. Finally, we identify prevailing challenges within each application domain and propose future research directions that need be explored in ubiquitous community. Our survey highlights the transformative potential of SNNs in enabling energy-efficient ubiquitous sensing across diverse application domains, while also serving as an essential introduction for researchers looking to enter this emerging field.</p></details> | 50 pages |

While prior work targeting Microcontroller Units (MCUs) has explored hardware-specific optimizations, such approaches are often task-specific and limited to 8-bit fixed-point precision. Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offer greater flexibility, enabling fine-grained control over data precision and architecture. However, existing FPGA-based deployments of Transformers for time-series analysis typically focus on high-density platforms with manual configuration. This paper presents a unified and fully automated deployment framework for Tiny Transformers on embedded FPGAs. Our framework supports a compact encoder-only Transformer architecture across three representative time-series tasks (forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection). It combines quantization-aware training (down to 4 bits), hardware-aware hyperparameter search using Optuna, and automatic VHDL generation for seamless deployment. We evaluate our framework on six public datasets across two embedded FPGA platforms. Results show that our framework produces integer-only, task-specific Transformer accelerators achieving as low as 0.033 mJ per inference with millisecond latency on AMD Spartan-7, while also providing insights into deployment feasibility on Lattice iCE40.

| **[An Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Model for High-Dimensional Tensor-Valued Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01658v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In autoregressive modeling for tensor-valued time series, Tucker decomposition, when applied to the coefficient tensor, provides a clear interpretation of supervised factor modeling but loses its efficiency rapidly with increasing tensor order. Conversely, canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition maintains efficiency but lacks a precise statistical interpretation. To attain both interpretability and powerful dimension reduction, this paper proposes a novel approach under the supervised factor modeling paradigm, which first uses CP decomposition to extract response and covariate features separately and then regresses response features on covariate ones. This leads to a new CP-based low-rank structure for the coefficient tensor. Furthermore, to address heterogeneous signals or potential model misspecifications arising from stringent low-rank assumptions, a low-rank plus sparse model is introduced by incorporating an additional sparse coefficient tensor. Nonasymptotic properties are established for the ordinary least squares estimators, and an alternating least squares algorithm is introduced for optimization. Theoretical properties of the proposed methodology are validated by simulation studies, and its enhanced prediction performance and interpretability are demonstrated by the El Ni$\tilde{\text{n}}$o-Southern Oscillation example.</p></details> |  |

By integrating implicit neural representations with latent variable models, TV-INRs learn distributions over time-continuous generator functions conditioned on signal-specific covariates. Unlike existing approaches that require extensive training, fine-tuning or meta-learning, our method achieves accurate individualized predictions through a single forward pass. Our experiments demonstrate that with a single TV-INRs instance, we can accurately solve diverse imputation and forecasting tasks, offering a computationally efficient and scalable solution for real-world applications. TV-INRs excel especially in low-data regimes, where it outperforms existing methods by an order of magnitude in mean squared error for imputation task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Causal-based Simulation for Realistic Time-series Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02084v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal Discovery plays a pivotal role in revealing relationships among observed variables, particularly in the temporal setup. While the majority of CD methods rely on synthetic data for evaluation, and recently for training, these fall short in accurately mirroring real-world scenarios; an effect even more evident in temporal data. Generation techniques depending on simplified assumptions on causal structure, effects and time, limit the quality and diversity of the simulated data. In this work, we introduce Temporal Causal-based Simulation (TCS), a robust framework for generating realistic time-series data and their associated temporal causal graphs. The approach is structured in three phases: estimating the true lagged causal structure of the data, approximating the functional dependencies between variables and learning the noise distribution of the corresponding causal model, each part of which can be explicitly tailored based on data assumptions and characteristics. Through an extensive evaluation process, we highlight that single detection methods for generated data discrimination prove inadequate, accentuating it as a multifaceted challenge. For this, we detail a Min-max optimization phase that draws on AutoML techniques. Our contributions include a flexible, model-agnostic pipeline for generating realistic temporal causal data, a thorough evaluation setup which enhances the validity of the generated datasets and insights into the challenges posed by realistic data generation. Through experiments involving not only real but also semi-synthetic and purely synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that while sampling realistic causal data remains a complex task, our method enriches the domain of generating sensible causal-based temporal data.</p></details> | 22 pages, 3 figures |

However, their performances vary between different domains and tasks. In LLM-based approaches, test-time adaptation using example-based prompting has become common, owing to the high cost of retraining. In the context of anomaly detection, which is the focus of this study, providing normal examples from the target domain can also be effective. However, time series foundation models do not naturally acquire the ability to interpret or utilize examples or instructions, because the nature of time series data used during training does not encourage such capabilities. To address this limitation, we propose a retrieval augmented time series foundation model (RATFM), which enables pretrained time series foundation models to incorporate examples of test-time adaptation. We show that RATFM achieves a performance comparable to that of in-domain fine-tuning while avoiding domain-dependent fine-tuning. Experiments on the UCR Anomaly Archive, a multi-domain dataset including nine domains, confirms the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |

The sequential nature of data collected from these environments has enabled improvements in Anomaly Detection using Machine Learning and Deep Learning models by processing time windows rather than treating the data as tabular. However, conventional explanation methods often neglect this temporal structure, leading to imprecise or less actionable explanations. This work presents ShaTS (Shapley values for Time Series models), which is a model-agnostic explainable Artificial Intelligence method designed to enhance the precision of Shapley value explanations for time series models. ShaTS addresses the shortcomings of traditional approaches by incorporating an a priori feature grouping strategy that preserves temporal dependencies and produces both coherent and actionable insights. Experiments conducted on the SWaT dataset demonstrate that ShaTS accurately identifies critical time instants, precisely pinpoints the sensors, actuators, and processes affected by anomalies, and outperforms SHAP in terms of both explainability and resource efficiency, fulfilling the real-time requirements of industrial environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages;16 figures;Submitted to Elsevier (Information Fusion)</p></details> |

Recent models for capturing temporal dependence have employed a bilinear representation for matrix time series, or the Tucker-decomposition based representation in case of tensor time series. A bilinear or Tucker-decomposition based temporal effect is difficult to interpret on many occasions, along with its computational complexity due to the non-convex nature of the underlying optimization problem. Moreover, the existing matrix case models have not sufficiently explored the possibilities of imposing any lower-dimensional pattern on the transition matrices. In this work, we propose a regularized additive matrix autoregressive model with additive interaction of row-wise and column-wise temporal dependence, that offers more interpretability, less computational burden due to its convex nature and estimation of the underlying low rank plus sparse pattern of its transition matrices. We address the issue of identifiability of the various components in our model and subsequently develop a scalable Alternating Block Minimization algorithm for estimating the parameters. We provide a finite sample error bound under high-dimensional scaling for the model parameters. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed model is demonstrated on synthetic and real data.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeGraph: Synthetic Benchmark Datasets for Robust Time-Series Causal Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01361v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust causal discovery in time series datasets depends on reliable benchmark datasets with known ground-truth causal relationships. However, such datasets remain scarce, and existing synthetic alternatives often overlook critical temporal properties inherent in real-world data, including nonstationarity driven by trends and seasonality, irregular sampling intervals, and the presence of unobserved confounders. To address these challenges, we introduce TimeGraph, a comprehensive suite of synthetic time-series benchmark datasets that systematically incorporates both linear and nonlinear dependencies while modeling key temporal characteristics such as trends, seasonal effects, and heterogeneous noise patterns. Each dataset is accompanied by a fully specified causal graph featuring varying densities and diverse noise distributions and is provided in two versions: one including unobserved confounders and one without, thereby offering extensive coverage of real-world complexity while preserving methodological neutrality. We further demonstrate the utility of TimeGraph through systematic evaluations of state-of-the-art causal discovery algorithms including PCMCI+, LPCMCI, and FGES across a diverse array of configurations and metrics.

| **[MADCluster: Model-agnostic Anomaly Detection with Self-supervised Clustering Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16223v4)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose MADCluster, a novel model-agnostic anomaly detection framework utilizing self-supervised clustering. MADCluster is applicable to various deep learning architectures and addresses the 'hypersphere collapse' problem inherent in existing deep learning-based anomaly detection methods. The core idea is to cluster normal pattern data into a 'single cluster' while simultaneously learning the cluster center and mapping data close to this center. Also, to improve expressiveness and enable effective single clustering, we propose a new 'One-directed Adaptive loss'. The optimization of this loss is mathematically proven. MADCluster consists of three main components: Base Embedder capturing high-dimensional temporal dynamics, Cluster Distance Mapping, and Sequence-wise Clustering for continuous center updates. Its model-agnostic characteristics are achieved by applying various architectures to the Base Embedder. Experiments on four time series benchmark datasets demonstrate that applying MADCluster improves the overall performance of comparative models. In conclusion, the compatibility of MADCluster shows potential for enhancing model performance across various architectures.</p></details> | 24 pages, 9 figures |

Future public health efforts must attempt to understand such content, what concerns it may raise among readers, and how to effectively respond to it. To this end, we present ConcernScope, a platform that uses a teacher-student framework for knowledge transfer between large language models and light-weight classifiers to quickly and effectively identify the health concerns raised in a text corpus. The platform allows uploading massive files directly, automatically scraping specific URLs, and direct text editing. ConcernScope is built on top of a taxonomy of public health concerns. Intended for public health officials, we demonstrate several applications of this platform: guided data exploration to find useful examples of common concerns found in online community datasets, identification of trends in concerns through an example time series analysis of 186,000 samples, and finding trends in topic frequency before and after significant events.</p></details> | 19 pages, 15 figures |
| **[TSRating: Rating Quality of Diverse Time Series Data by Meta-learning from LLM Judgment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01290v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality time series (TS) data are essential for ensuring TS model performance, rendering research on rating TS data quality indispensable. Existing methods have shown promising rating accuracy within individual domains, primarily by extending data quality rating techniques such as influence functions and Shapley values to account for temporal characteristics. However, they neglect the fact that real-world TS data can span vastly different domains and exhibit distinct properties, hampering the accurate and efficient rating of diverse TS data. In this paper, we propose TSRating, a novel and unified framework for rating the quality of time series data crawled from diverse domains. TSRating is built on the assumption that LLMs inherit ample knowledge, acquired during their extensive pretraining, enabling them to comprehend and discern quality differences in diverse TS data. We verify this assumption by devising a series of prompts to elicit quality comparisons from LLMs for pairs of TS samples. We then fit a dedicated rating model, termed TSRater, to convert the LLMs' judgments into efficient quality predictions via TSRater's inference on future TS samples. To ensure cross-domain adaptability, we develop a meta-learning scheme to train TSRater on quality comparisons collected from nine distinct domains. To improve training efficiency, we employ signSGD for inner-loop updates, thus circumventing the demanding computation of hypergradients. Extensive experimental results on eleven benchmark datasets across three time series tasks, each using both conventional TS models and TS foundation models, demonstrate that TSRating outperforms baselines in terms of estimation accuracy, efficiency, and domain adaptability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Weight-Space Linear Recurrent Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01153v1)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce WARP (Weight-space Adaptive Recurrent Prediction), a simple yet powerful framework that unifies weight-space learning with linear recurrence to redefine sequence modeling. Unlike conventional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) which collapse temporal dynamics into fixed-dimensional hidden states, WARP explicitly parametrizes the hidden state as the weights of a distinct root neural network. This formulation promotes higher-resolution memory, gradient-free adaptation at test-time, and seamless integration of domain-specific physical priors. Empirical validation shows that WARP matches or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on diverse classification tasks, spanning synthetic benchmarks to real-world datasets. Furthermore, extensive experiments across sequential image completion, dynamical system reconstruction, and multivariate time series forecasting demonstrate its expressiveness and generalization capabilities. Critically, WARP's weight trajectories offer valuable insights into the model's inner workings. Ablation studies confirm the architectural necessity of key components, solidifying weight-space linear RNNs as a transformative paradigm for adaptive machine intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 21 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |

Classical time series classification and deep learning techniques have demonstrated limited efficacy in monitoring PD symptoms using wearable accelerometer data due to complex PD movement patterns and the small size of available datasets. We investigate InceptionTime and RandOm Convolutional KErnel Transform (ROCKET) as they are promising for PD symptom monitoring. InceptionTime's high learning capacity is well-suited to modeling complex movement patterns, while ROCKET is suited to small datasets. With random search methodology, we identify the highest-scoring InceptionTime architecture and compare its performance to ROCKET with a ridge classifier and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) on wrist motion data from PD patients. Our findings indicate that all approaches can learn to estimate tremor severity and bradykinesia presence with moderate performance but encounter challenges in detecting dyskinesia. Among the presented approaches, ROCKET demonstrates higher scores in identifying dyskinesia, whereas InceptionTime exhibits slightly better performance in tremor and bradykinesia estimation. Notably, both methods outperform the multi-layer perceptron. In conclusion, InceptionTime can classify complex wrist motion time series and holds potential for continuous symptom monitoring in PD with further development.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The source code is available from https://github.com/cedricdonie/tsc-for-wrist-motion-pd-detection</p></details> |

With recent progress in large language models and time series learning, we revisit the integration of paired texts with time series through the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, which posits that representations of different modalities converge to shared spaces. In this context, we identify that time-series-paired texts may naturally exhibit periodic properties that closely mirror those of the original time series. Building on this insight, we propose a novel framework, Texts as Time Series (TaTS), which considers the time-series-paired texts to be auxiliary variables of the time series. TaTS can be plugged into any existing numerical-only time series models and enable them to handle time series data with paired texts effectively. Through extensive experiments on both multimodal time series forecasting and imputation tasks across benchmark datasets with various existing time series models, we demonstrate that TaTS can enhance predictive performance without modifying model architectures.

| **[Quantum Adaptive Self-Attention for Quantum Transformer Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05336v2)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer models have revolutionized sequential learning across various domains, yet their self-attention mechanism incurs quadratic computational cost, posing limitations for real-time and resource-constrained tasks. To address this, we propose Quantum Adaptive Self-Attention (QASA), a novel hybrid architecture that enhances classical Transformer models with a quantum attention mechanism. QASA replaces dot-product attention with a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) that adaptively captures inter-token relationships in the quantum Hilbert space. Additionally, a residual quantum projection module is introduced before the feedforward network to further refine temporal features. Our design retains classical efficiency in earlier layers while injecting quantum expressiveness in the final encoder block, ensuring compatibility with current NISQ hardware. Experiments on synthetic time-series tasks demonstrate that QASA achieves faster convergence and superior generalization compared to both standard Transformers and reduced classical variants. Preliminary complexity analysis suggests potential quantum advantages in gradient computation, opening new avenues for efficient quantum deep learning models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Fixed Variables: Expanding-variate Time Series Forecasting via Flat Scheme and Spatio-temporal Focal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15296v2)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF) has long been a key research focus. Traditionally, these studies assume a fixed number of variables, but in real-world applications, Cyber-Physical Systems often expand as new sensors are deployed, increasing variables in MTSF. In light of this, we introduce a novel task, Expanding-variate Time Series Forecasting (EVTSF). This task presents unique challenges, specifically (1) handling inconsistent data shapes caused by adding new variables, and (2) addressing imbalanced spatio-temporal learning, where expanding variables have limited observed data due to the necessity for timely operation. To address these challenges, we propose STEV, a flexible spatio-temporal forecasting framework. STEV includes a new Flat Scheme to tackle the inconsistent data shape issue, which extends the graph-based spatio-temporal modeling architecture into 1D space by flattening the 2D samples along the variable dimension, making the model variable-scale-agnostic while still preserving dynamic spatial correlations through a holistic graph. We introduce a novel Spatio-temporal Focal Learning strategy that incorporates a negative filter to resolve potential conflicts between contrastive learning and graph representation, and a focal contrastive loss as its core to guide the framework to focus on optimizing the expanding variables. We benchmark EVTSF performance using three real-world datasets and compare it against three potential solutions employing SOTA MTSF models tailored for EVSTF. Experimental results show that STEV significantly outperforms its competitors, particularly on expanding variables. Notably, STEV, with only 5% of observations from the expanding period, is on par with SOTA MTSF models trained with complete observations. Further exploration of various expanding strategies underscores the generalizability of STEV in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

On the objective side, we develop a machine learning model trained on mean opinion scores (MOS) computed via the ITU-T P.1203 reference implementation, allowing accurate prediction of user-perceived video quality using only network parameters such as packet loss, delay, jitter, and throughput without reliance on video content or client-side instrumentation. On the subjective side, we present a semantic filtering and scoring pipeline that processes user comments from live streams to extract performance-related feedback. A large language model is used to assign scalar MOS scores to filtered comments in a deterministic and reproducible manner. To support scalable and interpretable analysis, we construct a labeled dataset of 47,894 live-stream comments, of which about 34,000 are identified as QoE-relevant through multi-layer semantic filtering. Each comment is enriched with simulated Internet Service Provider attribution and temporally aligned using synthetic timestamps in 5-min intervals. The resulting dataset enables operator-level aggregation and time-series analysis of user-perceived quality. A delta MOS metric is proposed to measure each Internet service provider's deviation from platform-wide sentiment, allowing detection of localized degradations even in the absence of direct network telemetry. A controlled outage simulation confirms the framework's effectiveness in identifying service disruptions through comment-based trends alone. The system provides each operator with its own subjective MOS and the global platform average per interval, enabling real-time interpretation of performance deviations and comparison with objective network-based QoE estimates.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pp...</summary><p>19 ppages, 13 figures</p></details> |

This study presents LLM-Mixer, a framework that improves forecasting accuracy through the combination of multiscale time-series decomposition with pre-trained LLMs (Large Language Models). LLM-Mixer captures both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends by decomposing the data into multiple temporal resolutions and processing them with a frozen LLM, guided by a textual prompt specifically designed for time-series data. Extensive experiments conducted on multivariate and univariate datasets demonstrate that LLM-Mixer achieves competitive performance, outperforming recent state-of-the-art models across various forecasting horizons.

With growing interest in applying LLMs to the time series domain, this has proven nontrivial, as evidenced by the limited efficacy of straightforwardly adapting text-domain reasoning techniques. Although recent work has shown promise in several time series tasks, further leveraging advancements in LLM reasoning remains under-explored for time series classification (TSC) tasks, despite their prevalence and significance in many real-world applications. In this paper, we propose ReasonTSC, a novel framework designed to effectively leverage LLM reasoning for time series classification through both a multi-turn reasoning and a fused decision-making strategy tailored to TSC. Rather than straightforwardly applying existing reasoning techniques or relying solely on LLMs' built-in reasoning capabilities, ReasonTSC first steers the model to think over the essential characteristics of time series data. Next, it integrates predictions and confidence scores from plug-in classifiers, e.g., domain-specific time series models, as in-context examples. Finally, ReasonTSC guides the LLM through a structured reasoning process: it evaluates the initial assessment, backtracks to consider alternative hypotheses, and compares their merits before arriving at a final classification. Extensive experiments and systematic ablation studies demonstrate that ReasonTSC consistently outperforms both existing time series reasoning baselines and plug-in models, and is even capable of identifying and correcting plug-in models' false predictions.</p></details> |  |

However, accurately forecasting STTS is challenging due to complex dynamic correlations in both time and space dimensions. Existing graph neural networks struggle to balance effectiveness and efficiency in modeling dynamic spatio-temporal relations. To address this problem, we propose the Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Stiefel Graph Neural Network (DST-SGNN) to efficiently process STTS. For DST-SGNN, we first introduce the novel Stiefel Graph Spectral Convolution (SGSC) and Stiefel Graph Fourier Transform (SGFT). The SGFT matrix in SGSC is constrained to lie on the Stiefel manifold, and SGSC can be regarded as a filtered graph spectral convolution. We also propose the Linear Dynamic Graph Optimization on Stiefel Manifold (LDGOSM), which can efficiently learn the SGFT matrix from the dynamic graph and significantly reduce the computational complexity. Finally, we propose a multi-layer SGSC (MSGSC) that efficiently captures complex spatio-temporal correlations. Extensive experiments on seven spatio-temporal datasets show that DST-SGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods while maintaining relatively low computational costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IJCAI 2025</p></details> |

These distances allow for comparisons between finite-horizon linear behaviors represented by matrices of possibly different dimensions. They remain invariant under coordinate changes, rotations, and permutations, ensuring independence from input-output partitions. Moreover, they naturally encode complexity-misfit trade-offs for Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) behaviors, providing a principled solution to a longstanding puzzle in behavioral systems theory. The resulting framework characterizes modeling as a minimum distance problem, identifying the Most Powerful Unfalsified Model (MPUM) as optimal among all systems unfalsified by a given dataset. Finally, we illustrate the value of these metrics in a time series anomaly detection task, where their finer resolution yields superior performance over existing distances.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Control Systems Letters / 64th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control</p></details> |

However, reproducible benchmarks with sufficient spatiotemporal depth and contextual richness for long horizon prediction remain scarce. To address this, we introduce HouseTS a large scale, multimodal dataset covering monthly house prices from March 2012 to December 2023 across 6,000 ZIP codes in 30 major U.S. metropolitan areas. The dataset includes over 890K records, enriched with points of Interest (POI), socioeconomic indicators, and detailed real estate metrics. To establish standardized performance baselines, we evaluate 14 models, spanning classical statistical approaches, deep neural networks (DNNs), and pretrained time-series foundation models. We further demonstrate the value of HouseTS in a multimodal case study, where a vision language model extracts structured textual descriptions of geographic change from time stamped satellite imagery. This enables interpretable, grounded insights into urban evolution. HouseTS is hosted on Kaggle, while all preprocessing pipelines, benchmark code, and documentation are openly maintained on GitHub to ensure full reproducibility and easy adoption.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce QoQ-Med-7B/32B, the first open generalist clinical foundation model that jointly reasons across medical images, time-series signals, and text reports. QoQ-Med is trained with Domain-aware Relative Policy Optimization (DRPO), a novel reinforcement-learning objective that hierarchically scales normalized rewards according to domain rarity and modality difficulty, mitigating performance imbalance caused by skewed clinical data distributions. Trained on 2.61 million instruction tuning pairs spanning 9 clinical domains, we show that DRPO training boosts diagnostic performance by 43% in macro-F1 on average across all visual domains as compared to other critic-free training methods like GRPO. Furthermore, with QoQ-Med trained on intensive segmentation data, it is able to highlight salient regions related to the diagnosis, with an IoU 10x higher than open models while reaching the performance of OpenAI o4-mini. To foster reproducibility and downstream research, we release (i) the full model weights, (ii) the modular training pipeline, and (iii) all intermediate reasoning traces at https://github.com/DDVD233/QoQ_Med.</p></details> |  |

While most existing brain foundation models are pre-trained on time-series signals or region-of-interest (ROI) features, we propose a novel graph-based pre-training paradigm for constructing a brain graph foundation model. In this paper, we introduce the Brain Graph Foundation Model, termed BrainGFM, a unified framework that leverages graph contrastive learning and graph masked autoencoders for large-scale fMRI-based pre-training. BrainGFM is pre-trained on a diverse mixture of brain atlases with varying parcellations, significantly expanding the pre-training corpus and enhancing the model's ability to generalize across heterogeneous fMRI-derived brain representations. To support efficient and versatile downstream transfer, we integrate both graph prompts and language prompts into the model design, enabling BrainGFM to flexibly adapt to a wide range of atlases, neurological and psychiatric disorders, and task settings. Furthermore, we employ meta-learning to optimize the graph prompts, facilitating strong generalization to previously unseen disorders under both few-shot and zero-shot learning conditions via language-guided prompting. BrainGFM is pre-trained on 27 neuroimaging datasets spanning 25 common neurological and psychiatric disorders, encompassing 2 types of brain atlases (functional and anatomical) across 8 widely-used parcellations, and covering over 25,000 subjects, 60,000 fMRI scans, and a total of 400,000 graph samples aggregated across all atlases and parcellations.

By leveraging techniques from random matrix theory and free probability, we provide sharp asymptotics for the in- and out-of-sample risks of ridge regression when the data points have arbitrary correlations. We demonstrate that in this setting, the generalized cross validation estimator (GCV) fails to correctly predict the out-of-sample risk. However, in the case where the noise residuals have the same correlations as the data points, one can modify the GCV to yield an efficiently-computable unbiased estimator that concentrates in the high-dimensional limit, which we dub CorrGCV. We further extend our asymptotic analysis to the case where the test point has nontrivial correlations with the training set, a setting often encountered in time series forecasting. Assuming knowledge of the correlation structure of the time series, this again yields an extension of the GCV estimator, and sharply characterizes the degree to which such test points yield an overly optimistic prediction of long-time risk. We validate the predictions of our theory across a variety of high dimensional data.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 19 figures. v4: ICML 2025 camera-ready</p></details> |

In scenarios lacking extensive data from a target building, foundation models (FMs) represent a promising technology that can leverage prior knowledge from vast and diverse pre-training datasets to construct accurate probabilistic predictors for use in decision-making tools. This paper investigates the applicability and fine-tuning strategies of time-series foundation models (TSFMs) in building energy forecasting. We analyze both full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning approaches, particularly low-rank adaptation (LoRA), by using real-world data from a commercial net-zero energy building to capture signals such as room occupancy, carbon emissions, plug loads, and HVAC energy consumption. Our analysis reveals that the zero-shot predictive performance of TSFMs is generally suboptimal. To address this shortcoming, we demonstrate that employing either full fine-tuning or parameter-efficient fine-tuning significantly enhances forecasting accuracy, even with limited historical data. Notably, fine-tuning with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) substantially reduces computational costs without sacrificing accuracy. Furthermore, fine-tuned TSFMs consistently outperform state-of-the-art deep forecasting models (e.g., temporal fusion transformers) in accuracy, robustness, and generalization across varying building zones and seasonal conditions. These results underline the efficacy of TSFMs for practical, data-constrained building energy management systems, enabling improved decision-making in pursuit of energy efficiency and sustainability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Preli...</summary><p>Preliminary version appeared in NeurIPS TSALM Workshop: https://neurips.cc/virtual/2024/103019</p></details> |

For bounded variation paths, signature kernels were recently shown to solve a Goursat PDE. However, existing PDE solvers only use increments as input data, leading to first order approximation errors. These approaches become computationally intractable for highly oscillatory input paths, as they have to be resolved at a fine enough scale to accurately recover their signature kernel, resulting in significant time and memory complexities. In this paper, we extend the analysis to rough paths, and show, leveraging the framework of smooth rough paths, that the resulting rough signature kernels can be approximated by a novel system of PDEs whose coefficients involve higher order iterated integrals of the input rough paths. We show that this system of PDEs admits a unique solution and establish quantitative error bounds yielding a higher order approximation to rough signature kernels.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by success of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) methods, we propose a predictability-aware compression-decompression framework to reduce runtime, lower communication cost, and maintain prediction accuracy across diverse predictors. The core idea involves using a circular periodicity key matrix with orthogonality to capture underlying time series predictability during compression and to mitigate reconstruction errors during decompression by relaxing oversimplified data assumptions. Theoretical and empirical analyses show that the proposed framework is both time-efficient and scalable under a large number of channels. Extensive experiments on six datasets across various predictors demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior overall performance by jointly considering prediction accuracy and runtime, while maintaining strong compatibility with diverse predictors.</p></details> | 17 pages,3 figures |

Quantifying the status and resilience of colonies is essential to measure the impact of stressors and to identify colonies at risk. In this manuscript, we present and apply new methodologies to efficiently diagnose the status of a honey bee colony from widely available time series of hive and environmental temperature. Healthy hives have a remarkable ability to control temperature near the brood area. Our method exploits this fact and quantifies the status of a hive by measuring how resilient they are to extreme environmental temperatures, which act as natural stressors. Analysing 22 hives during different times of the year, including 3 hives that collapsed, we find the statistical signatures of stress that reveal whether honeybees are doing well or are at risk of failure. Based on these analyses, we propose a simple scale of hive status (stable, warning, and collapse) that can be determined based on a few temperature measurements. Our approach offers a lower-cost and practical bee-monitoring solution, providing a non-invasive way to track hive conditions and trigger interventions to save the hives from collapse.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 figures and 1 repository</p></details> |

In this paper, a novel imputation framework is proposed using Self-Attention-based Imputation networks for time series, which leverages the power of deep learning and self-attention mechanisms to impute missing data. We further refine the imputed data using a custom made autoencoder, tailored to represent smooth pursuit eye movement sequences. The proposed approach was implemented using 5,504 sequences from 172 Parkinsonian patients and healthy controls. Results show a significant improvement in the accuracy of reconstructed eye movement sequences with respect to other state of the art techniques, substantially reducing the values for common time domain error metrics such as the mean absolute error, mean relative error, and root mean square error, while also preserving the signal's frequency domain characteristics. Moreover, it demonstrates robustness when large intervals of data are missing. This method offers an alternative solution for robustly handling missing data in time series, enhancing the reliability of smooth pursuit analysis for the screening and monitoring of neurodegenerative disorders.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Here, we introduce a method that detects dependencies of any order in multivariate time series data. The method first transforms a multivariate time series into a symbolic sequence, and then extract statistically significant strings of symbols through a Bayesian approach. Such motifs are finally modelled as the hyperedges of a hypergraph, allowing us to use network theory to study higher-order interactions in the original data. When applied to neural and social systems, our method reveals meaningful higher-order dependencies, highlighting their importance in both brain function and social behaviour.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages (5 pages main manuscript and 10 pages supplemental material), 9 figures (2 main manuscript and 7 supplemental material)</p></details> |
| **[FRIREN: Beyond Trajectories -- A Spectral Lens on Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17370v3)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term time-series forecasting (LTSF) models are often presented as general-purpose solutions that can be applied across domains, implicitly assuming that all data is pointwise predictable. Using chaotic systems such as Lorenz-63 as a case study, we argue that geometric structure - not pointwise prediction - is the right abstraction for a dynamic-agnostic foundational model. Minimizing the Wasserstein-2 distance (W2), which captures geometric changes, and providing a spectral view of dynamics are essential for long-horizon forecasting. Our model, FRIREN (Flow-inspired Representations via Interpretable Eigen-networks), implements an augmented normalizing-flow block that embeds data into a normally distributed latent representation. It then generates a W2-efficient optimal path that can be decomposed into rotation, scaling, inverse rotation, and translation. This architecture yields locally generated, geometry-preserving predictions that are independent of the underlying dynamics, and a global spectral representation that functions as a finite Koopman operator with a small modification. This enables practitioners to identify which modes grow, decay, or oscillate, both locally and system-wide. FRIREN achieves an MSE of 11.4, MAE of 1.6, and SWD of 0.96 on Lorenz-63 in a 336-in, 336-out, dt=0.01 setting, surpassing TimeMixer (MSE 27.3, MAE 2.8, SWD 2.1). The model maintains effective prediction for 274 out of 336 steps, approximately 2.5 Lyapunov times. On Rossler (96-in, 336-out), FRIREN achieves an MSE of 0.0349, MAE of 0.0953, and SWD of 0.0170, outperforming TimeMixer's MSE of 4.3988, MAE of 0.886, and SWD of 3.2065. FRIREN is also competitive on standard LTSF datasets such as ETT and Weather. By connecting modern generative flows with classical spectral analysis, FRIREN makes long-term forecasting both accurate and interpretable, setting a new benchmark for LTSF model design.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Revisiting LLMs as Zero-Shot Time-Series Forecasters: Small Noise Can Break Large Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00457v1)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across diverse tasks without domain-specific training, fueling interest in their potential for time-series forecasting. While LLMs have shown potential in zero-shot forecasting through prompting alone, recent studies suggest that LLMs lack inherent effectiveness in forecasting. Given these conflicting findings, a rigorous validation is essential for drawing reliable conclusions. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs as zero-shot forecasters compared to state-of-the-art domain-specific models. Our experiments show that LLM-based zero-shot forecasters often struggle to achieve high accuracy due to their sensitivity to noise, underperforming even simple domain-specific models. We have explored solutions to reduce LLMs' sensitivity to noise in the zero-shot setting, but improving their robustness remains a significant challenge. Our findings suggest that rather than emphasizing zero-shot forecasting, a more promising direction would be to focus on fine-tuning LLMs to better process numerical sequences. Our experimental code is available at https://github.com/junwoopark92/revisiting-LLMs-zeroshot-forecaster.</p></details> | <details><summary>Annua...</summary><p>Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), 2025, Accepted as Short Paper</p></details> |
| **[Channel Normalization for Time Series Channel Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00432v1)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Channel identifiability (CID) refers to the ability to distinguish between individual channels in time series (TS) modeling. The absence of CID often results in producing identical outputs for identical inputs, disregarding channel-specific characteristics. In this paper, we highlight the importance of CID and propose Channel Normalization (CN), a simple yet effective normalization strategy that enhances CID by assigning distinct affine transformation parameters to each channel. We further extend CN in two ways: 1) Adaptive CN (ACN) dynamically adjusts parameters based on the input TS, improving adaptability in TS models, and 2) Prototypical CN (PCN) introduces a set of learnable prototypes instead of per-channel parameters, enabling applicability to datasets with unknown or varying number of channels and facilitating use in TS foundation models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CN and its variants by applying them to various TS models, achieving significant performance gains for both non-CID and CID models. In addition, we analyze the success of our approach from an information theory perspective. Code is available at https://github.com/seunghan96/CN.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[A New Spatiotemporal Correlation Anomaly Detection Method that Integrates Contrastive Learning and Few-Shot Learning in Wireless Sensor Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00420v1)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting anomalies in the data collected by WSNs can provide crucial evidence for assessing the reliability and stability of WSNs. Existing methods for WSN anomaly detection often face challenges such as the limited extraction of spatiotemporal correlation features, the absence of sample labels, few anomaly samples, and an imbalanced sample distribution. To address these issues, a spatiotemporal correlation detection model (MTAD-RD) considering both model architecture and a two-stage training strategy perspective is proposed. In terms of model structure design, the proposed MTAD-RD backbone network includes a retentive network (RetNet) enhanced by a cross-retention (CR) module, a multigranular feature fusion module, and a graph attention network module to extract internode correlation information. This proposed model can integrate the intermodal correlation features and spatial features of WSN neighbor nodes while extracting global information from time series data. Moreover, its serialized inference characteristic can remarkably reduce inference overhead. For model training, a two-stage training approach was designed. First, a contrastive learning proxy task was designed for time series data with graph structure information in WSNs, enabling the backbone network to learn transferable features from unlabeled data using unsupervised contrastive learning methods, thereby addressing the issue of missing sample labels in the dataset. Then, a caching-based sample sampler was designed to divide samples into few-shot and contrastive learning data. A specific joint loss function was developed to jointly train the dual-graph discriminator network to address the problem of sample imbalance effectively. In experiments carried out on real public datasets, the designed MTAD-RD anomaly detection method achieved an F1 score of 90.97%, outperforming existing supervised WSN anomaly detection methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Kernel-based Optimally Weighted Conformal Prediction Intervals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16828v2)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we present a novel conformal prediction method for time-series, which we call Kernel-based Optimally Weighted Conformal Prediction Intervals (KOWCPI). Specifically, KOWCPI adapts the classic Reweighted Nadaraya-Watson (RNW) estimator for quantile regression on dependent data and learns optimal data-adaptive weights. Theoretically, we tackle the challenge of establishing a conditional coverage guarantee for non-exchangeable data under strong mixing conditions on the non-conformity scores. We demonstrate the superior performance of KOWCPI on real and synthetic time-series data against state-of-the-art methods, where KOWCPI achieves narrower confidence intervals without losing coverage.</p></details> |  |
| **[LETS-C: Leveraging Text Embedding for Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06533v2)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in language modeling have shown promising results when applied to time series data. In particular, fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for time series classification tasks has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on standard benchmarks. However, these LLM-based models have a significant drawback due to the large model size, with the number of trainable parameters in the millions. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to leveraging the success of language modeling in the time series domain. Instead of fine-tuning LLMs, we utilize a text embedding model to embed time series and then pair the embeddings with a simple classification head composed of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and multilayer perceptron (MLP). We conducted extensive experiments on a well-established time series classification benchmark. We demonstrated LETS-C not only outperforms the current SOTA in classification accuracy but also offers a lightweight solution, using only 14.5% of the trainable parameters on average compared to the SOTA model. Our findings suggest that leveraging text embedding models to encode time series data, combined with a simple yet effective classification head, offers a promising direction for achieving high-performance time series classification while maintaining a lightweight model architecture.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 (Main Conference)</p></details> |
| **[Channel-Imposed Fusion: A Simple yet Effective Method for Medical Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00337v1)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The automatic classification of medical time series signals, such as electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG), plays a pivotal role in clinical decision support and early detection of diseases. Although Transformer based models have achieved notable performance by implicitly modeling temporal dependencies through self-attention mechanisms, their inherently complex architectures and opaque reasoning processes undermine their trustworthiness in high stakes clinical settings. In response to these limitations, this study shifts focus toward a modeling paradigm that emphasizes structural transparency, aligning more closely with the intrinsic characteristics of medical data. We propose a novel method, Channel Imposed Fusion (CIF), which enhances the signal-to-noise ratio through cross-channel information fusion, effectively reduces redundancy, and improves classification performance. Furthermore, we integrate CIF with the Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), known for its structural simplicity and controllable receptive field, to construct an efficient and explicit classification framework. Experimental results on multiple publicly available EEG and ECG datasets demonstrate that the proposed method not only outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in terms of various classification metrics, but also significantly enhances the transparency of the classification process, offering a novel perspective for medical time series classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Scalable k-Medoids Clustering via Whale Optimization Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16993v2)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised clustering has emerged as a critical tool for uncovering hidden patterns in vast, unlabeled datasets. However, traditional methods, such as Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM), struggle with scalability owing to their quadratic computational complexity. To address this limitation, we introduce WOA-kMedoids, a novel unsupervised clustering method that incorporates the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), a nature-inspired metaheuristic inspired by the hunting strategies of humpback whales. By optimizing the centroid selection, WOA-kMedoids reduces the computational complexity from quadratic to near-linear with respect to the number of observations, enabling scalability to large datasets while maintaining high clustering accuracy. We evaluated WOA-kMedoids using 25 diverse time-series datasets from the UCR archive. Our empirical results show that WOA-kMedoids achieved a clustering performance comparable to PAM, with an average Rand Index (RI) of 0.731 compared to PAM's 0.739, outperforming PAM on 12 out of 25 datasets. While exhibiting a slightly higher runtime than PAM on small datasets (<300 observations), WOA-kMedoids outperformed PAM on larger datasets, with an average speedup of 1.7x and a maximum of 2.3x. The scalability of WOA-kMedoids, combined with its high accuracy, makes them a promising choice for unsupervised clustering in big data applications. This method has implications for efficient knowledge discovery in massive unlabeled datasets, particularly where traditional k-medoids methods are computationally infeasible, including IoT anomaly detection, biomedical signal analysis, and customer behavior clustering.</p></details> | 19 pages, 7 figures |
| **[PerFormer: A Permutation Based Vision Transformer for Remaining Useful Life Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00259v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) for degradation systems is crucial in modern prognostic and health management (PHM). Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), initially developed for tasks like image and video recognition, have proven highly effectively in RUL prediction, demonstrating remarkable performance. However, with the emergence of the Vision Transformer (ViT), a Transformer model tailored for computer vision tasks such as image classification, and its demonstrated superiority over CNNs, there is a natural inclination to explore its potential in enhancing RUL prediction accuracy. Nonetheless, applying ViT directly to multivariate sensor data for RUL prediction poses challenges, primarily due to the ambiguous nature of spatial information in time series data. To address this issue, we introduce the PerFormer, a permutation-based vision transformer approach designed to permute multivariate time series data, mimicking spatial characteristics akin to image data, thereby making it suitable for ViT. To generate the desired permutation matrix, we introduce a novel permutation loss function aimed at guiding the convergence of any matrix towards a permutation matrix. Our experiments on NASA's C-MAPSS dataset demonstrate the PerFormer's superior performance in RUL prediction compared to state-of-the-art methods employing CNNs, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and various Transformer models. This underscores its effectiveness and potential in PHM applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cluster-Aware Causal Mixer for Online Anomaly Detection in Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00188v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early and accurate detection of anomalies in time series data is critical, given the significant risks associated with false or missed detections. While MLP-based mixer models have shown promise in time series analysis, they lack a causality mechanism to preserve temporal dependencies inherent in the system. Moreover, real-world multivariate time series often contain numerous channels with diverse inter-channel correlations. A single embedding mechanism for all channels does not effectively capture these complex relationships. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cluster-aware causal mixer to effectively detect anomalies in multivariate time series. Our model groups channels into clusters based on their correlations, with each cluster processed through a dedicated embedding layer. In addition, we introduce a causal mixer in our model, which mixes the information while maintaining causality. Furthermore, we present an anomaly detection framework that accumulates the anomaly evidence over time to prevent false positives due to nominal outliers. Our proposed model operates in an online fashion, making it suitable for real-time time-series anomaly detection tasks. Experimental evaluations across six public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model consistently achieves superior F1 scores.</p></details> |  |
| **[Timing is Important: Risk-aware Fund Allocation based on Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24835v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fund allocation has been an increasingly important problem in the financial domain. In reality, we aim to allocate the funds to buy certain assets within a certain future period. Naive solutions such as prediction-only or Predict-then-Optimize approaches suffer from goal mismatch. Additionally, the introduction of the SOTA time series forecasting model inevitably introduces additional uncertainty in the predicted result. To solve both problems mentioned above, we introduce a Risk-aware Time-Series Predict-and-Allocate (RTS-PnO) framework, which holds no prior assumption on the forecasting models. Such a framework contains three features: (i) end-to-end training with objective alignment measurement, (ii) adaptive forecasting uncertainty calibration, and (iii) agnostic towards forecasting models. The evaluation of RTS-PnO is conducted over both online and offline experiments. For offline experiments, eight datasets from three categories of financial applications are used: Currency, Stock, and Cryptos. RTS-PnO consistently outperforms other competitive baselines. The online experiment is conducted on the Cross-Border Payment business at FiT, Tencent, and an 8.4\% decrease in regret is witnessed when compared with the product-line approach. The code for the offline experiment is available at https://github.com/fuyuanlyu/RTS-PnO.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD 2025 ADS Track</p></details> |

Building Superior Neural Architectures by Preserving N-D Structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17353v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many high-impact machine learning tasks involve multi-dimensional data such as images, volumetric medical scans, and multivariate time-series. Yet, most neural architectures flatten these inputs, discarding critical cross-dimension information. We introduce $\textbf{NdLinear}$, a novel linear transformation that circumvents this destructive flattening by operating directly on tensors. NdLinear applies transformations separately along each data dimension, thereby preserving the native data structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate NdLinear's capacity to significantly enhance representational power, achieve dramatic parameter reductions (often by orders of magnitude), and maintain a favorable computational profile. For instance, when applied to Large Language Model finetuning, our $\textbf{NdLinear-LoRA}$ delivers comparable or improved accuracy on reasoning tasks using up to $9\times$ fewer trainable parameters than standard LoRA. These broad advantages of NdLinear are consistently validated across diverse neural architectures (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, MLPs) and data domains, including vision, language, time-series, and tabular tasks. As a versatile, drop-in replacement for standard linear layers, NdLinear processes data in its original N-dimensional form, offering a foundational component for developing more efficient and powerful next-generation neural architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/ensemble-core/NdLinear</p></details> |
| **[Mixing time of the conditional backward sampling particle filter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17572v3)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The conditional backward sampling particle filter (CBPF) is a powerful Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler for general state space hidden Markov model (HMM) smoothing. It was proposed as an improvement over the conditional particle filter (CPF), which is known to have an $O(T^2)$ computational time complexity under a general `strong' mixing assumption, where $T$ is the time horizon. While there is empirical evidence of the superiority of the CBPF over the CPF in practice, this has never been theoretically quantified. We show that the CBPF has $O(T \log T)$ time complexity under strong mixing. In particular, the CBPF's mixing time is upper bounded by $O(\log T)$, for any sufficiently large number of particles $N$ that depends only on the mixing assumptions and not $T$. We also show that an $O(\log T)$ mixing time is optimal. To prove our main result, we introduce a novel coupling of two CBPFs, which employs a maximal coupling of two particle systems at each time instant. As the coupling is implementable, it thus has practical applications. We use it to construct unbiased, finite variance, estimates of functionals which have arbitrary dependence on the latent state's path, with a total expected cost of $O(T \log T)$. As the specific application to real-data analysis, we construct unbiased estimates of the HMM's score function, leading to stochastic gradient maximum likelihood estimation of a financial time-series model. Finally, we also investigate other couplings and show that some of these alternatives can have improved empirical behaviour.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sundial: A Family of Highly Capable Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00816v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Sundial, a family of native, flexible, and scalable time series foundation models. To predict the next-patch's distribution, we propose a TimeFlow Loss based on flow-matching, which facilitates native pre-training of Transformers on continuous-valued time series without discrete tokenization. Conditioned on arbitrary-length time series, our models are pre-trained without specifying any prior distribution and can generate multiple probable predictions, achieving more flexibility in representation learning than using parametric densities. Towards time series foundation models, we leverage minimal but crucial adaptations of Transformers and curate TimeBench with one trillion time points, comprising mostly real-world datasets and synthetic data. By mitigating mode collapse via TimeFlow Loss, we pre-train a family of Sundial models on TimeBench, which achieve unprecedented model capacity and generalization performance. In addition to excellent scalability, Sundial achieves state-of-the-art results on both point and probabilistic forecasting benchmarks with a just-in-time inference speed, i.e., making zero-shot predictions within a few milliseconds. We believe that Sundial's pioneering generative forecasting capability can improve model reliability in real-world decision-making.

| **[Generating Hypotheses of Dynamic Causal Graphs in Neuroscience: Leveraging Generative Factor Models of Observed Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20697v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of hypothesis generation promises to reduce costs in neuroscience by narrowing the range of interventional studies needed to study various phenomena. Existing machine learning methods can generate scientific hypotheses from complex datasets, but many approaches assume causal relationships are static over time, limiting their applicability to systems with dynamic, state-dependent behavior, such as the brain. While some techniques attempt dynamic causal discovery through factor models, they often restrict relationships to linear patterns or impose other simplifying assumptions. We propose a novel method that models dynamic graphs as a conditionally weighted superposition of static graphs, where each static graph can capture nonlinear relationships. This approach enables the detection of complex, time-varying interactions between variables beyond linear limitations. Our method improves f1-scores of predicted dynamic causal patterns by roughly 22-28% on average over baselines in some of our experiments, with some improvements reaching well over 60%. A case study on real brain data demonstrates our method's ability to uncover relationships linked to specific behavioral states, offering valuable insights into neural dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal Weighted Convolution for Classification and Denosing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24558v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel weighted convolution operator that enhances traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by integrating a spatial density function into the convolution operator. This extension enables the network to differentially weight neighbouring pixels based on their relative position to the reference pixel, improving spatial characterisation and feature extraction. The proposed operator maintains the same number of trainable parameters and is fully compatible with existing CNN architectures. Although developed for 2D image data, the framework is generalisable to signals on regular grids of arbitrary dimensions, such as 3D volumetric data or 1D time series. We propose an efficient implementation of the weighted convolution by pre-computing the density function and achieving execution times comparable to standard convolution layers. We evaluate our method on two deep learning tasks: image classification using the CIFAR-100 dataset [KH+09] and image denoising using the DIV2K dataset [AT17]. Experimental results with state-of-the-art classification (e.g., VGG [SZ15], ResNet [HZRS16]) and denoising (e.g., DnCNN [ZZC+17], NAFNet [CCZS22]) methods show that the weighted convolution improves performance with respect to standard convolution across different quantitative metrics. For example, VGG achieves an accuracy of 66.94% with weighted convolution versus 56.89% with standard convolution on the classification problem, while DnCNN improves the PSNR value from 20.17 to 22.63 on the denoising problem. All models were trained on the CINECA Leonardo cluster to reduce the execution time and improve the tuning of the density function values. The PyTorch implementation of the weighted convolution is publicly available at: https://github.com/cammarasana123/weightedConvolution2.0.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 3 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Can Slow-thinking LLMs Reason Over Time? Empirical Studies in Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24511v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting (TSF) is a fundamental and widely studied task, spanning methods from classical statistical approaches to modern deep learning and multimodal language modeling. Despite their effectiveness, these methods often follow a fast thinking paradigm emphasizing pattern extraction and direct value mapping, while overlooking explicit reasoning over temporal dynamics and contextual dependencies. Meanwhile, emerging slow-thinking LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT-o1, DeepSeek-R1) have demonstrated impressive multi-step reasoning capabilities across diverse domains, suggesting a new opportunity for reframing TSF as a structured reasoning task. This motivates a key question: can slow-thinking LLMs effectively reason over temporal patterns to support time series forecasting, even in zero-shot manner? To investigate this, in this paper, we propose TimeReasoner, an extensive empirical study that formulates TSF as a conditional reasoning task. We design a series of prompting strategies to elicit inference-time reasoning from pretrained slow-thinking LLMs and evaluate their performance across diverse TSF benchmarks. Our findings reveal that slow-thinking LLMs exhibit non-trivial zero-shot forecasting capabilities, especially in capturing high-level trends and contextual shifts. While preliminary, our study surfaces important insights into the reasoning behaviors of LLMs in temporal domains highlighting both their potential and limitations. We hope this work catalyzes further research into reasoning-based forecasting paradigms and paves the way toward more interpretable and generalizable TSF frameworks.</p></details> |  |
